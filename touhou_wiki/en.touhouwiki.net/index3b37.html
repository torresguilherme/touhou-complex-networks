Okay, so let's discuss this in a talk page that can be referenced in the future. There was some previous discussion [[User talk:VasteelXolotl|here]], but given that it was in a user's talk page, it didn't get much traffic. Basically, there have been edits made and reverted that removed the Japanese part of Music title due to being perceived as redundant. Examples of this include 世界の果て　～ World's End going from End of the World ~ World's End to just World's End and 少女綺想曲　～ Capriccio going from Maiden's Capriccio ~ Capriccio to Maiden's Capriccio.

Personally, I echo what PK wrote in the previous discussion. A translation of a music title is just that, a translation. When we have a music title like JAPANESE ~ ENGLISH, ideally we translate the Japanese part and keep the rest of the music as intact as possible.  If the title has two parts you keep both even if the meaning is the same so that anyone reading the title actually gets to know what both parts mean without having to wonder why someone removed the Japanese part instead of translating it. It's still part of the music title and thus should not be removed. I will note that the two examples above had added annotations with "lit. End of the World ~ World's End" when it was changed to World's End. Why not just make that annotated translation the actual translation if it is more correct? For 少女綺想曲　～ Capriccio, the two "sides" so to speak are not even the same, one is "Maiden's Capriccio" and the other is just "Capriccio". Strange? Sure, but it is different and should not be perceived as redundant. --[[User:DTM|DTM]] ([[User talk:DTM|talk]]) 16:15, 17 April 2019 (UTC)

:Oh, I should've put this here in the first place. Oops.

:Translations of titles should be kept as close as possible, yes. However, the titles were originally already laid out as [Japanese title] ~ [English translation] (kinda like how ZUN does it in ''Shuusou Gyoku'', except in the cases I want to change it's in the titles themselves rather than omake files). You may be against giving those particular songs some sort of "exclusive treatment" since we generally keep everything, but these tautologies are introduced ''specifically'' due to translation, as it's now all in one language. Keeping both segments in these cases isn't necessarily more correct - to me it feels more ''overcorrect'', trying to keep everything the same due to some unwritten rule. In addition, I don't know why some of them are cut off while others aren't. What makes ''World's End'' special compared to ''Doll of Misery'' that necessiates keeping both parts, other than trying to keep old, inconsistent translations for status quo reasons? Or ''Casket of Stars''?

:The annotations were added as a compromise between both ways, where the needless part is out of direct view, but it's there as a footnote in case someone really wants to know. I can't imagine anyone actually getting confused, since to care and look for the untranslated titles (and reasons for cutting things out), you would need to have some prior knowledge in the first place, and at that point it's not exactly hard to come to the conclusion without any guidance. 

:Besides, this isn't something like omitting a previously untranslated part of EoSD's 3rd stage theme - it's removing something that's ''the exact same'' and translated word for word without regard for that. To me it's just slight translation corrections. [[User:VasteelXolotl|VasteelXolotl]] ([[User talk:VasteelXolotl|talk]]) 16:56, 17 April 2019 (UTC)

::Honestly speaking, the argument of "if other songs had the Japanese section cut off when translating, why not this one?" sounds equally like an argument for properly translating them instead of "cutting out the redundant words". 装飾戦　～ Decoration Battle into Decoration Battle, 霊天　～ Spiritual Heaven into Spiritual Heaven, 禁断の魔法　～ Forbidden Magic into Forbidden Magic and 悲しき人形　～ Doll of Misery into Doll of Misery.

::Music translations should be done to accurately translate what's there so people who don't know Japanese aren't left with "Huh? Why'd they just not bother translating the first part?"

::Yes you may come into some redundancies, especially with earlier music (sometimes not even though, 少女綺想曲 and Capriccio are two completely different words and definitely should not be combined into one). But the point of this place is to accurately translate what's presented, not make arbitrary decisions of "this sounds redundant, so just cut it out". Changes to old translations should be done to improve or fix old mistranslations and errors, but something like changing Vessel of Stars ~ Casket of Star into Casket of Stars feels like less of an improvement of the original translation and more personal preference from feeling that "Vessel of Stars" and "Casket of Star" sound too similar to one another.[[User:Megaman-Omega|Megaman-Omega]] ([[User talk:Megaman-Omega|talk]]) 17:16, 18 April 2019 (UTC)

:::Sure, a consistent approach would be the primary thing to consider over preferences in translation in this case. Still, I don't see why not. This ''does'' seem like a translation problem to me, since this really only becomes an "issue" when translated, and it's a result of trying to go for the highest possible accuracy over taking some liberties to make things seem more coherent to an English speaker. An issue in a few other places, actually. I should get on that sometime.

:::You could translate 器 in about a million ways just like any other character, but why would you, when you straight-up have the English translation right there? It's the same as other "redundant" songs, where I'm pretty sure the titles work in the way I laid out in my initial reply. Unless you want to propose translating the Japanese segments differently from the English counterparts in ''every'' song like that, in which case... well, I don't know what you could do with names like "眠れる恐怖" that wouldn't be stilted and make matters worse. I guess I can see the case for Maiden's Capriccio, though, since it's not ''literally'' the same. I've gone back on the Phantom Ensemble change for a similar reason.

:::As I've said before, I don't see how all this is a problem to people who don't know Japanese. In the first place, you have to learn of these changes and go out of your way to look up the music separately of the games to figure out just why they were made. I imagine reaching a conclusion by yourself at that point isn't hard. Buuuut you wouldn't particularly need to think/google much, since you'd have the annotations. Boom. 

:::If anything, I imagine your average Joe would go "ah, makes sense, it's the same thing" instead of "why would they ditch this?!" Matter of factly, the current English patches for the PC-98 games cut out the unnecessary parts in music and stages (with one exception) and still have the full Japanese titles in the Music Room, and I've yet to see anyone raise an eyebrow. Kind of a moot argument, I think. [[User:VasteelXolotl|VasteelXolotl]] ([[User talk:VasteelXolotl|talk]]) 20:08, 18 April 2019 (UTC)
::::"Your average Joe" is a little bit subjective.  Their opinion might change depending on how long they have been paying attention to the Touhou Project, especially the song titles.  Furthermore, I side with DTM and Megaman-Omega on this one, as there are plenty of instances where the Japanese before the tilde is not easily equatable to the English on the other side.  This even happens in areas that are not song titles, such as "東方神霊廟　～ Ten Desires".  Removing the translation on one side of the tilde dulls the clarification of the other. [[User:Code Slasher|Code Slasher]] ([[User talk:Code Slasher|talk]]) 04:28, 20 April 2019 (UTC)
:::::But I'm not arguing for that? 神霊廟 is as far from Ten Desires as it can possibly be. Not once have I talked about game titles, which always have two distinct parts. I don't see what enlightening context will this hypothetical average Joe gain from seeing "Sleeping Terror" twice back to back. [[User:VasteelXolotl|VasteelXolotl]] ([[User talk:VasteelXolotl|talk]]) 10:26, 20 April 2019 (UTC)

::::::Would it be worthwhile removing the redundancies, but then noting in a footnote that the first half of the title is the Japanese version of the second half? That way people know that there was originally two halves, but they know why we didn't include it in the translation. After all, it's inherently impossible for these translated titles to serve their original function (source language ~ translated language) unless we do something like (translated title ~ romanisation), which wouldn't really be ideal. I agree that we gain nothing from seeing "Sleeping Terror" twice back to back. [[User:Biggest Dreamer|Biggest Dreamer]] ([[User talk:Biggest Dreamer|talk]]) 06:11, 26 May 2019 (UTC)

:::::::That was my proposed solution for those exact reasons. I had the footnotes up on the LLS page for a while, actually. I think this option would make the most sense.
:::::::I changed all the titles to their redundant versions for the time being, but I'm still not at all convinced, either. Especially since one person completely missed the point and talked about game titles for some reason. [[User:VasteelXolotl|VasteelXolotl]] ([[User talk:VasteelXolotl|talk]]) 07:48, 26 May 2019 (UTC)
::::::::I thought you did that on purpose.  I think you are not understanding when there is an ''approximation'' versus an ''exact'' versus ''something entirely different''.  When you remove one side of a tilde for either an approximation or something entirely different, you are potentially removing clarification in a title.  What you are suggesting only works when they are exactly the same and/or there is no better alternative for the translation of the original Japanese, such as with "Sleeping Terror".  (In fact, there is a similar situation with some of the fan-made arrangements, like "UTAKATA -泡沫-" (both are "Foam").) [[User:Code Slasher|Code Slasher]] ([[User talk:Code Slasher|talk]]) 21:19, 26 May 2019 (UTC)
:::::::::I wasn't gonna weigh in on this originally but I thought I might just to see if I can offer a little insight on what seems to be an endless back and forth discussion. First and foremost, this is a wiki. We primarily record all things canon to the series. We should, ideally, preserve the titles no matter how redundant because, in the end, ZUN wrote them that way. But, we have leeway with translation. We don't have to have "Sleeping Terror ~ Sleeping Terror". Why not "Dormant Horror ~ Sleeping Terror", for example? That's a valid translation and it gets rid of a ridiculous title repetition. Why not? Same thing was done for Phantom Band, Casket of Star, and Luna Dial ("月時計　～ ルナ・ダイアル" is just the repetition of [moon]+[timepiece]). In order to remove hilarious redundancy, I propose that new translations be made. "End of the World ~ World's End" (世界の果て refers to the edge of the world; Pandemonium is canonically at the edge of Makai, according to Shiki) could be "Edge of Space ~ World's End" as 世界 can mean "realm" or "dimension" and Makai is, based on what little we know of it, no orb-shaped planet. These are just suggestions of course. If this idea is implemented we could always have a vote on titles. But, yeah. I believe that giving alternative translations to these titles is the perfect middle ground to outright removing them or keeping a ridiculously redundant title. Hopefully I don't sound too crazy making a suggestion like this. It's always an option. 
:::::::::—[[User:Ennin|Ennin]] ([[User talk:Ennin|talk]]) 01:51, 28 May 2019 (UTC)
::::::::::No, what you are saying is not too crazy.  In fact, I was advocating for exactly that (not getting rid of approximations), and this is also what used to be the status quo on here. [[User:Code Slasher|Code Slasher]] ([[User talk:Code Slasher|talk]]) 21:49, 29 May 2019 (UTC)
:::::::::::And I brought this up because I wanted some translation leeway, so I don't have anything against it either. I'm not sure if that's doable for every title (not that I'm particularly going through all of them to check now, but what about 霊天, off the top of my head?), but it'll come down to individual songs, so it's a valid approach.

<dl><dd>Whoa, calm down there. From an encyclopedic standpoint, it's okay to have some of the fanmade stuff in there, but there is a lot more to the characters in the canon works themselves than you may think. I just have a huge dislike for headers called "fun facts" that don't present information in any kind of organized manner. <a href="User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 18:28, 11 January 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl>

</p><p>Okay, I've made a much better (and simpler) example by completely reworking <a href="Nazrin.html" title="Nazrin">Nazrin</a>'s page. How does that look to people? <a href="User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 20:33, 16 January 2011 (UTC)
</p><p>I find it a bit bulky. However, it's not entirely bad: Rather, it's a matter of finding a better way to arrange all that information and removing unnecessary/pointless information. For example: How important/necessary is to have the Spellcard Information there? If people want it, then how about we give it a better layout? Also, I find a subsection on "Relationships" to be quite pointless, as they are mentioned in the Main Profile and don't really need a paragraph or two of information.  The information there can be part of the "Trivia" section, as long as it is really relevant or important to the character. The "Other" section might fall into "Trivia" as well. Also: Outline and Role? These two would work better as a single section... Something like "General Information", maybe? The less info sections we have, and the better organized they are, the better.
Also, should a link to this discussion should be added to the Main Page Discussion, so more contributors can come here and voice their opinion?

</p>
<dl><dd>I find the "Relationships" and "Spell Cards" sections to be useful for quick overviews, especially for newbies. On the former, the section in the text is good for fleshing out the summary in the profile.</dd>
<dd>The distinction between the Other, Trivia, and Fandom sections is, I suppose, the distinction between story, gameplay, and fan characterization?</dd>
<dd>The whole article does seem a bit...fragmented. I'm not sure how to put it. I feel like the organization could be shuffled around a little, and maybe we could have some different level headers. <font face="Comic Sans MS"><a href="User_Pufferfish101.html" title="User:Pufferfish101">Pufferfish</a><sup><a href="User_talk_Pufferfish101.html" title="User talk:Pufferfish101">101</a></sup></font> 22:33, 24 January 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>It looks fragmented because of the way the information is written and distributed. There are too many subsections, and many of them are too small.</dd>
<dd>I also think the Spellcards section is interesting and valuable info, but as it is right now it doesn't look good and feels like it takes up space that might be better used for other things.</dd>
<dd>If people want to keep the "Relationships" info, that's fine by me. However, bear in mind that it's also one of the smaller sections that make the whole thing look fragmented; it might look considerably better if incorporated into other bigger sections.</dd>
<dd>I'm gonna try and make some time tomorrow to whip out a quick prototype, highlighting possible improvements, as well as trying to find a solution to the Spell Card layout, which is my #1 concern. I'll post a link when it's ready. <a href="User_Anatole_serial.html" title="User:Anatole serial">Anatole serial</a> 08:36, 25 January 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I should add that the number of spell cards per character can be highly variable, from 0 (Rinnosuke) and 2 (Momiji) to 45 (Marisa) and 47 (three fairies). <a href="User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">Kiefmaster99</a> 09:21, 25 January 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Oh yes, I'm already taking that into account. Hence why I propose a solution in <a href="User_Anatole_serial/Nue_Houjuu_(Template_Test).html" title="User:Anatole serial/Nue Houjuu (Template Test)">this prototype</a>, by including a Collapsible Spellcard section. Notice how I also moved information around a bit, in an effort to reduce the number of fragmentary "main" sections by using subsections. I could've made a more profound edit of the general text in order to give it a better redaction, but I refrained from doing so, as this is merely a "proof of concept" and not the final article. What do you guys think of this prototype? <a href="User_Anatole_serial.html" title="User:Anatole serial">Anatole serial</a> 07:49, 26 January 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Well, 1) I find that it's in an awkward place, 2) maybe it's just me but I get redirected to top of page when opening/closing, 3) spell cards is two separate words. I take it that it serves as a brief list, which it does well since it's ordered neatly, in which case the larger one which I haven't worked on for a while could just serve as a more exhaustive one (which I have ordered chronologically and kept Japanese names, for sake of TL consistency across the wiki). There are other factors that can complicate ordering (e.g. trios, cards that exist both standalone and with a sign (Comet) "Blazing Star", etc.) but I'll leave that until the issue arises. In short, can use some more work but looks promising. <a href="User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">Kiefmaster99</a> 05:15, 27 January 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I can't seem to find a good place for a box like that. So, in <a href="User_Anatole_serial/Nue_Houjuu_(Template_Test).html" title="User:Anatole serial/Nue Houjuu (Template Test)">the latest version</a> I moved things around and gave it back its own section, this time aiming for a representation that can accommodate Spell Cards that are repeated across multiple games. It's not noticeable in Nue's case, but, say, <a href="Aya_Shameimaru.html" title="Aya Shameimaru">Aya</a>'s "Illusionary Dominance" appears in <a href="Scarlet_Weather_Rhapsody/Spell_Cards/Aya_Shameimaru.html#Spell_Card_6" title="Scarlet Weather Rhapsody/Spell Cards/Aya Shameimaru">|SWR</a>, <a href="Mountain_of_Faith/Spell_Cards/Stage_4.html#Spell_Card_51" title="Mountain of Faith/Spell Cards/Stage 4">|MoF</a>, and <a href="Double_Spoiler/Spell_Cards/Spoiler_Stage.html#Spell_Card_.3F.3F_-_9" class="mw-redirect" title="Double Spoiler/Spell Cards/Spoiler Stage">|DS</a>. I also moved other sections around, for clarity and order's sake. I also am toying with another idea ATM: How many people believe that I should include a Related Music information in a table similar to the Spell Cards one? As always, suggestions and ideas are always greatly appreciated. <a href="User_Anatole_serial.html" title="User:Anatole serial">Anatole serial</a> 07:12, 29 January 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Looks better. With music, I don't think it needs its own section since there are far less songs to deal with. Most characters have 1 or 2, depending on whether you want to count stage music, and at most up to 7 (Marisa has Witches Ball, Magus Night, Love Coloured Magic, Love Coloured Master Spark, Oriental Dark Flight, Casket of Star, Dim. Dream). It could probably just go in the profile. <a href="User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">Kiefmaster99</a> 08:21, 29 January 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>That means I have two questions: Should we start organizing profiles in this manner, and should a "Music Themes" section be added to the profile template? The first one should take time, but the second one can be done relatively quickly. If there are no objections, I can start working through UFO's cast later today.<a href="User_Anatole_serial.html" title="User:Anatole serial">Anatole serial</a> 00:37, 4 February 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I like the new layout. Sure it can be better, but it's already better than the old one, which is limited to 2 sections.
Spellcard section is great, I've been forced to search for a character's spell card in different Game pages, and its painful for characters that appear in several games, like Reimu. I personally think the spellcard section for Nazrin (Feb 3, 2011, 1pm PST) looks good; however, it should be put at the bottom of the page. I also think the section division to be a little confusing, and can have overlaps, like Past/Role/Incident can contain similar information and can be combined into a "Story"(or something) section. Also, "Others" and "Speculation" sections can be the new "Fun facts". "Relationship" can be combined into "Personality and Behavior" as a subsection. Too many sections, maybe?
To me, I would arrange the sections like this:
</p>
<ul><li>Summary
<ul><li>Name</li></ul></li>
<li>Ability</li>
<li>Personality (which might include a relationship section)</li>
<li>Story (subsections may not be needed if this is not too long)
<ul><li>Past</li>
<li>Incidents/Role/Appearance</li></ul></li>
<li>Fun facts
<ul><li>Meta</li>
<li>Canon</li>
<li>Fanon</li></ul></li>
<li>Links
<ul><li>Spellcard</li>
<li>Games appeared in</li></ul></li>
<li>Official profile</li></ul>

<dl><dd>The problem here is that most of that information already appears int he Main Profile at the top of the page, which does a fairly good job summarizing the most general information about the character. The rest of the information can appear 'after' the Main Profile.</dd>
<dd>However, some of that information is too short / ambiguous to give it a more Informative structure. Remember, the Wiki's purpose is to maintain and disseminate information as accurately as possible through community contributions.</dd>
<dd>Have you seen how I arranged the information in <a href="User_Anatole_serial/Nue_Houjuu_(Template_Test).html" title="User:Anatole serial/Nue Houjuu (Template Test)">This Sample Page</a>? It's more streamlined and organized, without having many small-ish Main Sections, and taking all the subsections that are too small into a more general area. <a href="User_Anatole_serial.html" title="User:Anatole serial">Anatole serial</a> 00:54, 4 February 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Mmm... yes, that looks better than the Mokou page right now. Still, I think the reason is because not enough information is put into the Nue page rather than too much info in the Mokou page. I tried <a href="Kogasa_Tatara.html" title="Kogasa Tatara">this</a>; but I must admit, it's basically your layout, with minor tweaks.<a href="User_Jimreynold2nd.html" title="User:Jimreynold2nd">Jimreynold2nd</a> 07:57, 4 February 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I think this was mentioned at some point earlier, but can we change the Japanese character titles in the infoboxes back to English so it's more immediately apparent? It seems kind of odd to leave them in Japanese, in my opinion. <a href="User_NForza.html" title="User:NForza">NForza</a> 14:54, 2 May 2012 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Well, from what I've gathered based on looking at <a href="Sakuya_Izayoi.html" title="Sakuya Izayoi">Sakuya's</a> edit history, the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../index8c22.html?title=Sakuya_Izayoi&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=211419&amp;oldid=211016">character titles started out in Japanese</a>. I'm all for changing them to English while preserving the use of <a href="Template_H_title.html" title="Template:H:title">Template:H:title</a> though. Just switch the two parameters around and it'll be fine. <a href="User_K.html" title="User:K">K</a> 21:17, 2 May 2012 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Yeah, that would be fine, too. <a href="User_NForza.html" title="User:NForza">NForza</a> 11:14, 3 May 2012 (UTC)

<p>For example, those Return to Touhou Wiki things on every page. I really think this is unnecessary. Is there some kind of justification for this being here? <a href="User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 17:22, 6 January 2011 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I always thought it was just a convenience thing, although the Alice logo in the upper left kinda nullifies that. Maybe to help those who aren't as wiki-literate find a way back to the main page?</dd>
<dd>Now if we're talking about, say, the subpages of fangames which add a link back to the main fan page game, I think those are pretty useful. But if there's a better implementation a la user subpages automatically linking back to the main userpage, that would be nice. <font face="Comic Sans MS"><a href="User_Pufferfish101.html" title="User:Pufferfish101">Pufferfish</a><sup><a href="User_talk_Pufferfish101.html" title="User talk:Pufferfish101">101</a></sup></font> 02:03, 7 January 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>My issues with it are that 1) even if you went to a user subpage, or any subpage, really, you <i>should be able to</i> get back to the parent page simply by clicking the back button on your browser, assuming the pages have been structured properly and 2) I've never seen another wiki with them. <a href="User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 15:50, 7 January 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>The back button will usually work, but in the instances where it doesn't, having a link back to the main article is useful. That's not really important though, as there are plenty of ways to do that without the "unique" method we have now. For instance, using normal wiki links or even a "See Also" section or the subpage links I was talking about earlier. Unless someone makes a bot though, we're going to have to make manual changes to practically every page on the wiki. <font face="Comic Sans MS"><a href="User_Pufferfish101.html" title="User:Pufferfish101">Pufferfish</a><sup><a href="User_talk_Pufferfish101.html" title="User talk:Pufferfish101">101</a></sup></font> 19:56, 7 January 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Return to Main Page is pointless, since you can just click Alice. But I like the link back to a main article, for example on the <a href="PMiSS.html" class="mw-redirect" title="PMiSS">PMiSS</a> pages, because you might have followed a link from elsewhere and don't have the main article in your history. <a href="User_Keiji.html" title="User:Keiji">Keiji</a> 20:01, 7 January 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>So, with that consensus, does that mean we can kill all the return to Main Page links now? <font face="Comic Sans MS"><a href="User_Pufferfish101.html" title="User:Pufferfish101">Pufferfish</a><sup><a href="User_talk_Pufferfish101.html" title="User talk:Pufferfish101">101</a></sup></font> 20:41, 7 January 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Sounds good to me. We can leave the other link-backs around(for now, at least :P) <a href="User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 21:51, 7 January 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Would this affect Google rankings of the main page? <a href="User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">Kiefmaster99</a> 23:04, 7 January 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>It appears that KennyMan666's subpage movement is the solution to this. Subpages include an automatic tiny little link at the top of the page back to the parent page. I say we just get rid of these manual links as we convert pages into subpages. <a href="User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 18:37, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

</p><p>No, I don't.

<p>The guidelines say we use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hepburn romanization">Hepburn style romanization</a>, but there's a few variants of it (traditional/revised/modified). Which one does the wiki use, specifically? I'm particularly interested in what to do with long vowel sounds and 'n'. The vast majority of the pages seem to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wāpuro_rōmaji" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Wāpuro rōmaji">Wāpuro rōmaji</a>, so I'm wondering if that means we'll have to go back and edit those articles. (What's preferred, ou or ō?) As for the ん, do we make it into m in those cases or keep it as n?

<dl><dd>It's an odd variant, if you can even call it that. It follows Hepburn in the sense that it is used over Kunrei, while the spellings themselves actually tend to follow kana spellings/Wāpuro (Yuugi, Yuuka). As someone who wrote part of that section, I more or less wrote down the de facto standard used.

</p>
<dl><dd>It's A) the most common, popular spelling. And B) used in PCB. But frankly, I wish we would, as well. Due to our romanization policy it's the most accurate fit. Also, as seen when we previously changed some spellcard and song translations from what's popular to what's accurate, much to the dismay of the internet, we've shown that we don't really care for what's popular, anyway. Furthermore, even with our own romanization standards we basically disregard what ZUN wamts and what's used in official Touhou already. So IMO making Gensokyo the exception is kind of arbitrary and that it <i>should</i> change. <a href="User_UTW.html" title="User:UTW">UTW</a> 12:31, 10 April 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Has the use of paragraphs or bullets in trivia or fandom been discussed? I consider the omission of bullets, or the introduction of long paragraphs to the fandom section, as it stands now, to disrupt the flow of the character articles.</dd>
<dd>Both trivia and fandom were originally under the heading Fun Facts. "Fun Facts" were just that, tidbits of little known stuff, whether canon or established in fandom, whether of English or Japanese origin. About a year ago, Fun Facts became separated into Trivia and Fandom, to separate canon from fanon. Any format changes done to one would naturally have to be done to the other (i.e. if the fandom format becomes chaged, so would trivia).</dd>
<dd>As well, using bullets in Trivia, followed by non-bullets in Fandom, flows unnaturally. Fandom would have to be moved up before trivia, which may raise the ire of some editors who prefer to keep Fandom after all canon. Either that, or Trivia would have to be rewritten in paragraphs.</dd>
<dd>In any case, I prefer to keep those sections as concise as possible. <a href="User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> 15:46, 23 January 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I would prefer all trivia to be at the bottom. Trivia by definition means "unimportant facts," Fandom, on the other hand, is definitely not the same thing as "trivia." It is <b>not</b> a subset of trivia. It is <b>not</b> a list of random facts like trivia. It would be preferable if there could be some fandom sections in paragraph form than in bullet point form. I would suggest "Fandom" be moved above trivia, and maybe for trivia to be further divided into two sections, canon and fandom.--<a href="User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">Tosiaki</a> 17:12, 23 January 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Ah, I should note that the Fun Facts became renamed Additional Info it seems, although it does seems that Fandom is treated as trivia. As well, I would consider it a bad idea to separate trivial fandom from the rest of fandom. First, it flows poorly. Second, it creates the question of "What fandom is considered trivia?". This becomes too subjective and allows 'popular fanon' to trump over less-known ones. That being said, we already exclude lesser-known fanon outright. <a href="User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> 18:00, 23 January 2012 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Trivia was probably a poor choice for naming the section, then. After all, "trivia" means it is trivial. Maybe "additional considerations" would be better. Or simply, "Additional Information."</dd>

<dd>To make myself more clear, I think that rather than bunching together "Trivia" and "Fandom" under "Additional Information," perhaps they should fully be separate, as simply "Additional Information" and "Fandom"--<a href="User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">Tosiaki</a> 20:25, 23 January 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

</p>
<ol><li>Separate "Trivia" from "Fandom" completely, maybe renaming "Trivia" to "Additional Information" and "Fandom" to "Fanon"</li>
<li>Turn the "fandom" sections into paragraph format. When describing fanon, there is little reason to need to use bullet points.</li></ol>

</p><p>My main intention is with how we use the layout of the pages. This is a wiki that uses both canon and fanon information, but they need to be kept separate (unless vitally and high-levelly necessary, which I mean for stuff like what's under the Name section on both <a href="Tokiko.html" title="Tokiko">Tokiko</a>'s and the <a href="Five_Magic_Stones.html" title="Five Magic Stones">Five Magic Stones</a> articles. That's how strong the "Wiki Border" (as I like to call it) is lol). For pages with official content (e.g. characters, locations, games etc.), it should be separated from fanon information. Since they're pages that talks about official stuff, I would find it kinda weird to start talking big about the character, location, game etc. pages in fandom on a form of paragraphs, so I disagree with turning fandom into paragraphs and keep it the whole section in bullets. My main reason is because that, as Kief said, is the former Fun Facts section that still uses the bulleted layout. With that, it makes it easier for the visitor to read. Let's say s/he reads the seventh bullet. When s/he wants to look at it again later, s/he can count down the number of bullets to the seventh one to read that fun fact instead of happening to read thought the paragraphs s/he doesn't want to read and just say to him/herself "I just wasted time reading large text when I didn't want to read that! *Some more time later* Ah, it was right in the middle of this part of this paragraph right in the middle of Fandom... *¬.¬*". To add to this, adding sub-sections for each paragraph would also be odd and whether "Fandom" of "Fanon" I don't mind either way. 
</p><p>About "Trivia" and where it's laid... Well, everything under Trivia was meant to be "interesting facts", not "uninteresting". So if there is a word that is better than Trivia and it does mean "interesting facts" in some way, then let's use that word (but big wiki's like the Mario wiki and sometimes even Wikipedia uses this word, but idk why they do if it does mean "unimportant" lol when the list is in fact interesting). About "Additional Information"... Since everything under both Fandom and Trivia are additional stuff, it makes sense to have them kept there. Going back to Fandom, everything under there is additional information to the character. Well, we do have Nazeo's <a href="Contemplations.html" title="Contemplations">Contemplations</a> page lol ;)
</p><p><b>HOWEVER!!!!</b>, so some reason, I kinda agree with taking out Fandom and Trivia from Additional Information and use the Additional Information section as any other stuff that's vitally and high-levelly necessary to write in paragraphs rather than sticking it under Trivia (for e.g., Utsuho's nuclear thing). It will solve some situations with stuff like Utsuho's nuclear thing on how we lay the pages out. Going back to Fandom/Trivia, yes (if anyone's coming to a conclusion), we'll use h2 == on both sections. I'm going to do an edit on the standardisation page to show an example with what I mean.

<dl><dd>I guess that with the kind of information that is presently in the "fandom" sections, it does make sense for it to be in bullet point rather than paragraphs. However, I think that the only reason for this is due to the legacy of having been part of the former "Fun Facts" portion. Due to this, the things that are in the "fandom" sections now are not so much an attempt to sketch a picture of how the character is commonly portrayed in fanon as it is a set of "fun facts about this character's fanon." I do think this is one deficiency about the fandom sections right now - they do not adequately talk about the how the character generally is in fanon, which is why I think I would eventually want to add more to all of these sections so that the information is there. When this information is added, I think that some of it might make more sense in paragraph rather than in bullet point format. However, I guess we will have to wait and see until then, so I agree with sticking with bullet pints for now.--<a href="User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">Tosiaki</a> 22:47, 24 January 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Obviously all fanon things should be in fandom. However, there has recently come up the subject about talking about canon in fandom. The reason for doing so is obvious: to compare fanon and canon, and talk about exactly what discrepancy or non-discrepancy exists. Obviously, in order to do so, one needs to talk about fanon and canon at the same time - that is the only way to make such statements like "while in fanon, ..., in canon, contrary to fanon, ..." etc. After all, it only makes sense to make comparisons between fanon and canon. As the pages are right now, it would only make sense to talk about such things in the fandom section.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>You could just state something like "Although she does not get along with other magicians, she has been portrayed/depected" or shorter, plus cite. I don't see why the second point is needed.

<dd>On a different note, there is no need to assign titles to fandom facts, or if we are, English convention is preferred.

<h2><span id="Group_column_(Lyrics_article)_for_compilation_albums"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Group_column_.28Lyrics_article.29_for_compilation_albums">Group column (Lyrics article) for compilation albums</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="../index921d-2.html?title=Touhou_Wiki_talk:Guidelines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="Edit section: Group column (Lyrics article) for compilation albums">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>I've come across various lyrics pages from compilation albums, like the ones from <i><a href="%e3%81%a8%e3%82%89%e3%81%ae%e3%81%82%e3%81%aa.html" title="とらのあな">とらのあな</a></i> or <i>Reitaisai Official Compilation Arrange CD Production Committee</i>. However, they all have a different content in the "| group=" column, for the Reitaisai ones it's only <i>Reitaisai 7 Official Compilation Arrange CD Production Committee</i> (e.g.<a href="Lyrics__-Ultired-.html" title="Lyrics: -Ultired-">this one</a> or <a href="Lyrics__U.N.html" title="Lyrics: U.N.オーエンはJIMANGの彼女なのか？">this one</a>), but for the Toranoana ones I and <a href="User_Tegamin.html" title="User:Tegamin">Tegamin</a> have decided for <i>Toranoana/CIRCLE NAME</i> (e.g. <a href="Lyrics__Cloud_nine.html" title="Lyrics: Cloud nine">here</a>) because we thought it would make sense to put both, the album publisher (which is Toranoana in this case) and the circle's name due to the category (which will appear on the bottom too).
Even so, we noticed edits by <a href="User_Quwanti.html" title="User:Quwanti">Quwanti</a> who has deleted the <i><a href="%e3%81%a8%e3%82%89%e3%81%ae%e3%81%82%e3%81%aa.html" title="とらのあな">とらのあな</a></i> labels, so that the circle's name is the only one in this column. And now we're confused, which one is right? Is there a reason for the changes? And does an official guideline exists and if not, I'd propose to discuss one. Otherwise it's quite confusing to us editors. <a href="User_Mai88.html" title="User:Mai88">Mai88</a> (<a href="Usertalk_Mai88.html?title=Usertalk:Mai88&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Usertalk:Mai88 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:55, 28 August 2014 (CET)
</p>
<dl><dd>This is also applicable on those compilation albums who are published by a single circle who has its own songs, but also include tracks by other artists (<a href="%e7%8f%be%e5%a4%a2.html" title="現夢">two</a> <a href="%e3%81%82%e3%82%8a%e3%81%99%e2%80%a0%e3%81%bb%e3%82%8a%e3%81%a3%e3%81%8f.html" title="ありす†ほりっく">examples</a>). Anyway, I propose to put in the "|group=" field just the circle who has actually made the song and put the circle/label who has published it in an album as a category (with [[Category:]]). <a href="User_Tegamin.html" title="User:Tegamin">Tegamin</a> (<a href="User_talk_Tegamin.html" title="User talk:Tegamin">talk</a>) 10:09, 2 April 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>A fairy may have abilities relating to the four seasons, weather, emotions, longevity, decay, fertility, or other aspects of nature. The power exercised by a single fairy is usually harmless and small scale, so they're more suited to playing around rather than causing major happenings. Fortunately, most fairies are easily amused by pulling pranks on unsuspecting humans. However, since fairies tend to gather in areas frequented by humans and youkai, a large group of fairies may indicate the presence of a powerful youkai.

<p>In the case for <a href="Cirno.html" title="Cirno">Cirno</a>'s game sprites and for the fairies who showed up in <i><a href="Touhou_Sangetsusei.html" title="Touhou Sangetsusei">Touhou Sangetsusei</a></i>, there were many who took the form of <a href="Humanoid.html" title="Humanoid">humanoid</a> children with wings, usually mayfly- or butterfly-like, though more unusual cases exist (such as <a href="Cirno.html" title="Cirno">Cirno</a>'s triple icicle wings). It is thus common to perceive all fairies to look that way. However, as an exception, the <a href="Fairy_Maid.html" title="Fairy Maid">Fairy Maids</a> from the <a href="Scarlet_Devil_Mansion.html" title="Scarlet Devil Mansion">Scarlet Devil Mansion</a> looked more like adults.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Therefore, it does not seem like all fairies look like young girls. For those who showed up in <i>Touhou Sangetsusei</i>, in terms of design, they actually looked more like little girls than young girls. This is due to the design of <a href="Makoto_Hirasaka.html" title="Makoto Hirasaka">Makoto Hirasaka</a>.
</p><p>Their wings might not be solid; in most depictions, they appear to float over the fairy's clothes, unconnected to their body, and some fairies have shown the ability to hide them<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>.

<p>Fairies spring forth from nature, and as long as that nature is preserved, they're indestructible. On the other hand, if that nature is lost, the fairies who spring forth from that disappear forever. Among the powers of <a href="Gensokyo.html" title="Gensokyo">Gensokyo</a>, they exist in considerable numbers, and guessing from sayings in the manga, they are fewer than <a href="Spirit.html" title="Spirit">spirits</a>, but are probably around the same number as <a href="Phantom.html" title="Phantom">phantoms</a> and far greater than the number of <a href="Human.html" title="Human">humans</a>. As this is merely numbers, it is not related to their strength.
</p><p>It's not clear what kinds of fairies spring forth from what kinds of nature, but taking <a href="Lily_White.html" title="Lily White">Lily White</a> as an example who is the "fairy of spring", it can be conceived that the nature is the season of spring. Other than in spring, it is a mystery what Lily does and where she is. Some logical possibilities include the idea that she would sleep due to losing energy or due to being ill-suited to the conditions that she disappears due to coming forth only when the condition is met, or that she turns into another kind of fairy. However, in <i><a href="Silent_Sinner_in_Blue.html" title="Silent Sinner in Blue">Silent Sinner in Blue</a></i>, since she made an appearance at the party at the <a href="Scarlet_Devil_Mansion.html" title="Scarlet Devil Mansion">Scarlet Devil Mansion</a>, which opened in winter, the possibility that she disappears or becomes debilitated outside of spring is quite low.
</p><p>To <a href="Cirno.html" title="Cirno">Cirno</a>, the <a href="Three_Fairies_of_Light.html" title="Three Fairies of Light">Three Fairies of Light</a> said, "for your season, when spring arrives, you would then become out of season," and so Cirno provoked that winter ought to fight, thus indicating a high possibility that when the nature from which the fairy sprung forth becomes weak, the fairy would become weaker accordingly, and that the fairies are aware of this themselves. However, when it is not winter, since Cirno does not seem to become extremely weakened, this might just be a mistake due to the Three Fairies of Light. In the first place, since it has not been seen that Cirno becomes stimulated upon the arrival of winter the same way as for Lily White of spring, and since it seems like she does not really like winter all that much due to its boredom, she might not actually be a fairy who springs forth from winter.
</p><p>Since they spring forth from nature, they do not leave children, as it would be unnecessary in the first place. However, with the introduction of <a href="Lampad.html" title="Lampad">lampads</a> with <a href="Clownpiece.html" title="Clownpiece">Clownpiece</a>, there are now also a species of fairies that can be said to be born from other beings, and <a href="ZUN.html" title="ZUN">ZUN</a> also confirmed the idea of lampads in the <i><a href="Strange_Creators_of_Outer_World.html" title="Strange Creators of Outer World">Strange Creators of Outer World</a></i> interview.

<div class="thumb tleft"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:152px;"><a href="File_FS_Three_Fairies_of_Light.html" class="image"><img alt="" src="../images/thumb/3/3c/FS_Three_Fairies_of_Light.jpg/150px-FS_Three_Fairies_of_Light.jpg" width="150" height="197" class="thumbimage"></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="File_FS_Three_Fairies_of_Light.html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>The <a href="Three_Fairies_of_Light.html" title="Three Fairies of Light">Three Fairies of Light</a> in <i><a href="Forbidden_Scrollery.html" title="Forbidden Scrollery">Forbidden Scrollery</a></i>, where <a href="Sunny_Milk.html" title="Sunny Milk">Sunny Milk</a> is shown considerably smaller than <a href="Marisa_Kirisame.html" title="Marisa Kirisame">Marisa Kirisame</a></div></div></div>
<p>Their height is uniformly small, where they can fit in the palm of a hand, up to the size of a child below ten years of age; there is hardly any fairy outside of this scope.<sup id="cite_ref-PMiSSFairy_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PMiSSFairy-3">[3]</a></sup> This was said in <i><a href="Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense.html" title="Perfect Memento in Strict Sense">Perfect Memento in Strict Sense</a></i>, which is not reliable due to requests from the <a href="Youkai.html" title="Youkai">youkai</a> to change how strong they seem, but due to the number of fairies and their range from the <a href="Human_Village.html" title="Human Village">Human Village</a>, it's likely that there'd be no reason to write lies in relation to fairies. However, since it was written that there are merely "hardly any" fairies outside of the scope, that still leaves open the possibility of exceptions.
</p><p>In reality, girls of 9 years of age have the average height of around 130cm, so a fairies size goes from being in palm of a hand to around 130cm. As for whether there would be an exception to being bigger than this, it is a mystery since there is much conflicting information regarding their size. Since they a characteristic of become stronger or weaker depending on their surroundings, they might possibly also change their size due to their surroundings as well, although that's just speculation.
</p><p>In chapter 8 of <i><a href="Strange_and_Bright_Nature_Deity.html" title="Strange and Bright Nature Deity">Strange and Bright Nature Deity</a></i>, <a href="Sakuya_Izayoi.html" title="Sakuya Izayoi">Sakuya Izayoi</a> intended to capture <a href="Lily_White.html" title="Lily White">Lily White</a> in a bottle. If this is not a misunderstanding, then Lily White would be extremely small. However, it is somewhat of a question as for whether this actually did happen since there were not many scenes in the manga where her size could be compared to surrounding objects, so it is a mystery if Lily White really is tiny. However, she was seen at normal size in chapter 9 of <i><a href="Silent_Sinner_in_Blue.html" title="Silent Sinner in Blue">Silent Sinner in Blue</a></i>, <i><a href="Perfect_Cherry_Blossom.html" title="Perfect Cherry Blossom">Perfect Cherry Blossom</a></i> and <i><a href="Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View.html" title="Phantasmagoria of Flower View">Phantasmagoria of Flower View</a></i>.
</p><p>In the manga, the <a href="Three_Fairies_of_Light.html" title="Three Fairies of Light">Three Fairies of Light</a> were shorter than <a href="Marisa_Kirisame.html" title="Marisa Kirisame">Marisa Kirisame</a>. Marisa's size is "fairly short", while <a href="Cirno.html" title="Cirno">Cirno</a>'s size is "short", where other characters in the same category are <a href="Remilia_Scarlet.html" title="Remilia Scarlet">Remilia Scarlet</a>, <a href="Lyrica_Prismriver.html" title="Lyrica Prismriver">Lyrica Prismriver</a>, <a href="Chen.html" title="Chen">Chen</a>, <a href="Rumia.html" title="Rumia">Rumia</a> and <a href="Flandre_Scarlet.html" title="Flandre Scarlet">Flandre Scarlet</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-ZUN.27sEmail_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ZUN.27sEmail-4">[4]</a></sup> I Due to this, and also due to scenes where Cirno and the three fairies played or performed pranks together, where there is not much of a difference in height to be seen between them, they are probably around the same height as the aforementioned characters as well. Also in <i><a href="Touhou_Hisoutensoku.html" title="Touhou Hisoutensoku">Touhou Hisoutensoku</a></i>, when comparing Cirno against Remilia, their heights are very similar.
</p><p>However, in Shanghai Alice Correspondence Three Fairies Version Volume 2, concerning the three fairies' place of residence, it stated, "in each of their rooms, it is about one mat spacious, and on the level of 1 meter tall, and a place that is definitely not spacious enough for adult <a href="Human.html" title="Human">humans</a> to enter." Due to this, it can be understood to be considerably narrow. Interpreted as it is, their height would be less than 100cm, but since in the manga, they reach the ceiling to the extent that others usually do, they're conceivably of a height even shorter than this. However, even if they live in such a small space, it was said that they lived in a large tree, but if their residence is this small, then it becomes impossible to see it as so giant of a tree, thus complicating the issue of their size and residence. There was one time when Cirno went into the three fairies' residence, but it was extremely confined. However, since the size of the room became clear; there are interpretations that they might become smaller upon entering their residence. The world's largest tree is a giant sequoia that's around 11.1m in diameter and it'd probably be difficult to create several rooms 1 mat wide and 1 meter tall.
</p><p>There's a sense that it'd be impossible consider it a place to live for <a href="Human.html" title="Human">humans</a>, and for fairies to live there would be a plus to the tree, as it's been confirmed that living there has an effect of promoting its growth, but even considering this, it still seems inconceivable that no damage would be dealt to the tree by physically removing a great amount of space from the middle of the tree, as in the case for flowers, there'd be the possibility of inflicting fatal damage even for fairies at a tiny size. However, one thing to be noted is that when the three fairies change residence, they diligently move all their belongings, but it doesn't seem like they do large-scale work even if the tree was split in two by lightning<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>. This leads to several logical conclusions, such as the possibility that their place of residence is like another dimension, and thus the size of the tree could be smaller than their residence, or that the fairies become smaller when they enter.

<p>Since they exist only in the bounds that the nature they spring from be preserved, they're <a href="Immortal.html" title="Immortal">immortal</a> in some sense. It's unknown if they have everlasting youth, but there hasn't been a depiction where any have been depicted to have aged appearance-wise. In the afterword for <i><a href="Strange_and_Bright_Nature_Deity.html" title="Strange and Bright Nature Deity">Strange and Bright Nature Deity</a></i> Vol. 1, it stated, "minors are prohibited from drinking sake, but since fairies are long-lived, in order not to misunderstand..." and if this is to be followed, then the Three Fairies of Light would be at least 20 years of age (NB: the drinking age in Japan is 20). In <i><a href="Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View.html" title="Phantasmagoria of Flower View">Phantasmagoria of Flower View</a></i>, <a href="Cirno.html" title="Cirno">Cirno</a> said, "It's the festival that happens once every sixty years!" and if Cirno did experience the previous cycle's incident, then Cirno would've lived for at least 60 years.
</p><p>However, fairies aren't undying, as it's been made clear that there's a condition that's like death, mentioned in <i>Strange in Bright Nature Deity</i> as "going out of commission"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">一回休み</span>)</span>, and the fact that <a href="Komachi_Onozuka.html" title="Komachi Onozuka">Komachi Onozuka</a> states fairies have got no life span, being similar to <a href="Phantom.html" title="Phantom">phantoms</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-PoFVKomachi_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PoFVKomachi-6">[6]</a></sup> The reasons for death aren't different at all from that of a <a href="Human.html" title="Human">human</a>, and for example, at New Year's Eve, there was a conversation at the <a href="Hakurei_Shrine.html" title="Hakurei Shrine">Hakurei Shrine</a> where <a href="Star_Sapphire.html" title="Star Sapphire">Star Sapphire</a> said, "I heard the humans have a custom where they'll get drunk and fall asleep and freeze to death in the snow," to which <a href="Sunny_Milk.html" title="Sunny Milk">Sunny Milk</a> responded, "Haha, how peaceful. We'd only be dead until sunrise, though."<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Since this was said on New Year's Eve, in the understanding of the <a href="Three_Fairies_of_Light.html" title="Three Fairies of Light">Three Fairies of Light</a>, it seems like they'd recover in a night, but also it seems like this speed would be different depending on the circumstances.
</p><p>In <i><a href="Subterranean_Animism.html" title="Subterranean Animism">Subterranean Animism</a></i>, the <a href="Zombie_Fairy.html" title="Zombie Fairy">Zombie Fairies</a> were merely pretending to be zombies, but in the game itself, they became half-transparent and stopped, and recovered a few seconds later.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> However it is conceived, they recovered instantly. A possibility is that this is convenient for gameplay, or that they might just be fairies that recovered extremely fast.
</p><p>Even when speaking of a "finished off" state, since it's an incident occurring within the <a href="Spell_card.html" title="Spell card">spell card</a> rules, it can be conceived that they don't die at all, and that to "go out of commission" is something different from death. This somewhat resembles the debate as for whether <a href="Fujiwara_no_Mokou.html" title="Fujiwara no Mokou">Fujiwara no Mokou</a> actually dies when she uses "resurrection" (die and immediately recover) or if it is simply a performance in spell card battles. It's been said that in battles under the spell card rules, death does occur due to accidents, but this is probably not something that would occur frequently.

<p>Fairies live pretty much everywhere, be it in <a href="Gensokyo.html" title="Gensokyo">Gensokyo</a>, the <a href="Underworld.html" title="Underworld">Underworld</a>, <a href="Makai.html" title="Makai">Makai</a> and even in <a href="Hell.html" title="Hell">Hell</a> or on the <a href="Moon.html" title="Moon">Moon</a><sup id="cite_ref-LoLKReisen_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LoLKReisen-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CPProfile_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CPProfile-11">[11]</a></sup>. Since they receive the influence of the surrounding nature in their environment, they have delicate differences in strength and appearance. The <a href="Three_Fairies_of_Light.html" title="Three Fairies of Light">Three Fairies of Light</a> had a residence in the <a href="Forest_of_Magic.html" title="Forest of Magic">Forest of Magic</a>, and later moved into a tree near the <a href="Hakurei_Shrine.html" title="Hakurei Shrine">Hakurei Shrine</a>. <a href="Cirno.html" title="Cirno">Cirno</a> also has a residence close to the <a href="Misty_Lake.html" title="Misty Lake">Misty Lake</a> that is somewhat like an igloo.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>
</p><p>Other fairies also have similar dwellings, but it may take up a great amount of space considering their numbers. As <a href="Marisa_Kirisame.html" title="Marisa Kirisame">Marisa Kirisame</a> said, "they mostly cleverly hide themselves in nature, like inside flowers or in the soil"<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>. Like in the case of the tree used as residence by the Three Fairies of Light, which has apparently visible features like windows, it seems humans would generally not notice a fairy's dwelling, as to them it would look like an ordinary tree. <a href="Reimu_Hakurei.html" title="Reimu Hakurei">Reimu Hakurei</a> didn't notice their dwelling despite being near it several times.
</p><p>As an exception, when Marisa was called over for incident resolution regarding the Three Fairies of Light, she was able to recognize their residence. However, she wasn't seen entering it. There were also cases when the fairies themselves invited others over, but it's unclear what can be confirmed about the kind of place they live in. For the tree that Reimu didn't notice as a dwelling, there was a time when <a href="Yukari_Yakumo.html" title="Yukari Yakumo">Yukari Yakumo</a> saw through that they lived there. In the same way, the Three Fairies of Light were able to discover Cirno's residence, and destroyed it, which lead to the events of <i><a href="Fairy_Wars.html" title="Fairy Wars">Fairy Wars</a></i>.
</p><p>The size of their residence is a mystery (refer to the "Size and height mystery section"). Since there was a scene in <i><a href="Touhou_Sangetsusei.html" title="Touhou Sangetsusei">Touhou Sangetsusei</a></i> where Reimu and the Three Fairies of Light faced each other through a window, since it at least can't be seen that the window and the Three Fairies became smaller, it may just be like another dimension. However, it can't be confirmed that a window was outside.
</p><p>There are also fairies who live in human-made residences for humans to live in, such as the <a href="Fairy_Maid.html" title="Fairy Maid">Fairy Maids</a> living in the <a href="Scarlet_Devil_Mansion.html" title="Scarlet Devil Mansion">Scarlet Devil Mansion</a>. There was also the fairy of rainy season who lived in the attic of <a href="Kourindou.html" title="Kourindou">Kourindou</a>. It's unknown if fairies live in the <a href="Human_Village.html" title="Human Village">Human Village</a>, but concerning fairies, whose purpose of existence is to perform mischief to humans, it can be considered that there aren't many cases of those who live close to humans.
</p><p>Perhaps to perform mischief, they frequently appear in the Human Village.<sup id="cite_ref-PMiSSFairy_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PMiSSFairy-3">[3]</a></sup> That's the reason why they can be caught, for venting anger on them, which <a href="Hieda_no_Akyuu.html" title="Hieda no Akyuu">Hieda no Akyuu</a> also recommended.
</p><p>Prior to the events of <a href="Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom.html" title="Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom">Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom</a>, <a href="Junko.html" title="Junko">Junko</a> and Hecatia Lapislazuli imported several fairies from <a href="Hell.html" title="Hell">Hell</a> to the <a href="Moon.html" title="Moon">Moon</a>, but it's stated by <a href="Clownpiece.html" title="Clownpiece">Clownpiece</a> that fairies already lived there even before.<sup id="cite_ref-LoLKReisen_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LoLKReisen-10">[10]</a></sup><i><a href="Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom.html" title="Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom">Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom</a></i>: <a href="Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom/Story/Reisen%27s_Scenario.html" title="Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Story/Reisen's Scenario">Reisen's Scenario</a>&lt;/ref&gt;.

<p>According to <i><a href="Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense.html" title="Perfect Memento in Strict Sense">Perfect Memento in Strict Sense</a></i>, fairies do not require food to stay alive, and there's only been cases of fairies eating food because they seemed delicious. However, they do have taste, and they like food that human children like. <a href="Luna_Child.html" title="Luna Child">Luna Child</a> is an exception for liking coffee.

</p><p>There was a scene in <i><a href="Touhou_Sangetsusei.html" title="Touhou Sangetsusei">Touhou Sangetsusei</a></i> where a fairy changed clothing, and in all scenes so far, they change into clothes of the same design as before.

<p>Many fairies see playing mischief on <a href="Human.html" title="Human">humans</a> as their purpose in life. In <i><a href="Touhou_Sangetsusei.html" title="Touhou Sangetsusei">Touhou Sangetsusei</a></i>, they often steal and pick up ingredients and tools, like coffee. The <a href="Kourindou.html" title="Kourindou">Kourindou</a> has also been a victim to this before. They appear to be disliked by humans.
</p><p><a href="Cirno.html" title="Cirno">Cirno</a> is well-known for freezing frogs. Also, there was a scene where she played hide-and-seek with <a href="Daiyousei.html" title="Daiyousei">Daiyousei</a>.

Fairies often play with each other and other species. According to <a href="Sakuya_Izayoi.html" title="Sakuya Izayoi">Sakuya Izayoi</a>, <a href="Fairy_maid-2.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Fairy maid">Fairy maids</a> are rarely of any use in the <a href="Scarlet_Devil_Mansion.html" title="Scarlet Devil Mansion">Scarlet Devil Mansion</a>, and are unsuited towards performing complex tasks, relating to how fairies are not very smart.
</p><p>Since fairies maids do at least exist, it means they are at least able to do some tasks a maid can. They have been confirmed to wash clothes, cook and play musical instruments. Thus, despite not being smart, they can still perform a variety of tasks.

<p>Fairies are weak. They often appear as generic, weak <a href="Stage_enemies.html" title="Stage enemies">stage enemies</a> alongside <a href="Phantom.html" title="Phantom">phantoms</a> and <a href="Flying_yin-yang.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Flying yin-yang">flying yin-yang</a>, and often appear in game just for the sake of being defeated. Unlike spirits, though, most fairies can speak, according to one of <a href="ZUN.html" title="ZUN">ZUN</a>'s e-mails. <a href="Daiyousei.html" title="Daiyousei">Daiyousei</a> is an exception for having a greater amount of power among the fairies.
</p><p>When the <a href="Three_Fairies_of_Light.html" title="Three Fairies of Light">Three Fairies of Light</a>, who are considered stronger among the fairies, together fought <a href="Yukari_Yakumo.html" title="Yukari Yakumo">Yukari Yakumo</a>, they were unable to inflict any damage and were called "very weak". In <i><a href="Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense.html" title="Perfect Memento in Strict Sense">Perfect Memento in Strict Sense</a></i>, the fairies <a href="Cirno.html" title="Cirno">Cirno</a> and <a href="Sunny_Milk.html" title="Sunny Milk">Sunny Milk</a> were evaluated with danger level "low". <a href="Hieda_no_Akyuu.html" title="Hieda no Akyuu">Hieda no Akyuu</a> wrote that it is safe to even go and take revenge for their mischief by capturing them. However, Cirno and <a href="Lily_White.html" title="Lily White">Lily White</a> are comparatively strong, so they can be dangerous to the ordinary <a href="Human.html" title="Human">human</a>.
</p><p>Sometimes they play "pranks that go too far", like making humans fall from cliffs, and that would be a dangerous aspect of them. Thus, Akyuu recommended to take caution in places where a fairy might be there.
</p><p>Sunny Milk once said that Lily White was dangerous and one must not get close to her. According to Akyuu, Cirno is one of the stronger of the fairies, and since she is used to battle, Cirno has the upper hand even if she goes against all <a href="Three_Fairies_of_Light.html" title="Three Fairies of Light">Three Fairies of Light</a> at the same time, as shown in <i><a href="Fairy_Wars.html" title="Fairy Wars">Fairy Wars</a></i>. Among the fairies, she also has a greater tendency to fight, which makes her more dangerous than normal fairies. According to <a href="Eiki_Shiki%2c_Yamaxanadu.html" title="Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu">Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu</a>, Cirno has quite a bit of power despite being a fairy.
</p><p>In <i><a href="Touhou_Sangetsusei.html" title="Touhou Sangetsusei">Touhou Sangetsusei</a></i>, the Three Fairies of Light have had their power levels remain constant throughout. Daiyousei was remarked to be "one with power among the fairies". Thus, to normal fairies, she has more power than the average one, but not enough to match Cirno's level. The fairies appear very powerful in <i><a href="Fairy_Wars.html" title="Fairy Wars">Fairy Wars</a></i>, but it was in Cirno's perspective, and she is just capable to stand against <a href="Marisa_Kirisame.html" title="Marisa Kirisame">Marisa Kirisame</a>, a powerful human.

<p>Fairies are generally not clever. For example, in the manual for <i><a href="Fairy_Wars.html" title="Fairy Wars">Fairy Wars</a></i>, it was remarked, "when the war ends, they will completely forget everything they said." They are about on the level of a child, but there is also variation. Here are examples of things that they can do:
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Talk</b>
<dl><dd><a href="Lily_White.html" title="Lily White">Lily White</a> has been depicted to speak more than "spring is here." In fact, all fairies are able to speak, according to one of <a href="ZUN.html" title="ZUN">ZUN</a>'s e-mails. However, it has been remarked that they would not understand more difficult talk. <i><a href="Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense.html" title="Perfect Memento in Strict Sense">Perfect Memento in Strict Sense</a></i> mentioned that when one encounters a relatively more dangerous fairy like <a href="Cirno.html" title="Cirno">Cirno</a>, one could get away by confusing them with a riddle.</dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Read &amp; Write</b>
<dl><dd><a href="Sunny_Milk.html" title="Sunny Milk">Sunny Milk</a> writes kanji in <i><a href="Touhou_Sangetsusei.html" title="Touhou Sangetsusei">Touhou Sangetsusei</a></i>. Cirno writes everything in hiragana, but she sometimes makes mistakes. According to <i><a href="Bohemian_Archive_in_Japanese_Red.html" title="Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red">Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red</a></i>, Cirno reads the <a href="Bunbunmaru_Newspaper.html" title="Bunbunmaru Newspaper">Bunbunmaru Newspaper</a>, meaning she is able to at least understand the kinds of opinion pieces written in them. Also, in <a href="Hisoutensoku.html" title="Hisoutensoku">Hisoutensoku</a>, she begs for <a href="Aya_Shameimaru.html" title="Aya Shameimaru">Aya Shameimaru</a> to write more about her, indicating that she takes at least somewhat of an interest in it. Luna Child also likes to read the Bunbunmaru Newspaper. When there's something she doesn't know, namely about family altars, she goes to do research by reading about it in books, and it appears that she understands it at least somewhat.</dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Cook</b>
<dl><dd><a href="Fairy_Maid.html" title="Fairy Maid">Fairy Maids</a> and <a href="Star_Sapphire.html" title="Star Sapphire">Star Sapphire</a> cook. The things Star cooked appear to require the usage of fire, pans, and knives. <a href="Sunny_Milk.html" title="Sunny Milk">Sunny Milk</a> and <a href="Luna_Child.html" title="Luna Child">Luna Child</a> ran a successful food stall, meaning they are also capable of a good level of cooking.</dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Remember winter events during spring</b>
<dl><dd>In the spring, Cirno remembered the <a href="Three_Fairies_of_Light.html" title="Three Fairies of Light">Three Fairies of Light</a> declaring war back in winter. However, she forgot about it until spring arrived. Luna said that the event where they destroyed Cirno's house was "something that happened way back," which could indicate bad memory or mean that they have a greater sense of time passing than that of a humans.</dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Run a stall</b>
<dl><dd>In <i><a href="Touhou_Sangetsusei.html" title="Touhou Sangetsusei">Touhou Sangetsusei</a></i>, the Three Fairies of Light were seen running a stall at the <a href="Hakurei_Shrine.html" title="Hakurei Shrine">Hakurei Shrine</a>. Sunny was selling Oden; Luna was selling alcohol, fuuki miso, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yakitori" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:yakitori">yakitori</a> and pig legs; and Star was selling yoyotsuri, and they looked like they were a success, but nobody bought the out-of-season shaved ice (mizuaji) from Cirno. Cirno also didn't know why nobody bought it.</dd>
<dd>Thus, fairies are at least able to understand how running a business works, and able to perform the tasks that are require to prepare and run it.</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Since they don't require food, and live within nature, they generally have no need for money. Fairies steal things as a prank, but they've said that they never steal money. The three fairies have visited the <a href="Myouren_Temple.html" title="Myouren Temple">Myouren Temple</a> without needing to disguise themselves, indicating that despite their mischief, there is no overt hatred against them.
</p><p>Despite not needing money to live, some fairies like Cirno or the Three Fairies of Light might decide to start businnesses such as food stalls, presumably to earn money. The latter were apparently quite successful in their intent.

<p>The fairies once again appeared as general enemies in <i><a href="Perfect_Cherry_Blossom.html" title="Perfect Cherry Blossom">Perfect Cherry Blossom</a></i> throughout the game. A new feature is that a number of fairies have a magic circle around them, which indicates that they're stronger fairies that'll shoot more <a href="Danmaku.html" title="Danmaku">danmaku</a> and that they're non-trivial to defeat. On stage 4 and onward, there appears to be fairies that are re-used from the previous game, being identical to the <a href="Fairy_Maid.html" title="Fairy Maid">Fairy Maids</a>, although they can be presumed not to be fairy maids due to not being a the <a href="Scarlet_Devil_Mansion.html" title="Scarlet Devil Mansion">Scarlet Devil Mansion</a> and the fact <a href="Sakuya_Izayoi.html" title="Sakuya Izayoi">Sakuya Izayoi</a> can take them down, knowing that she wouldn't attack her own staff.
</p><p>On stage 2, they'll first appear in transparent orbs, then after a while of waiting, they'll pop out and immediately shoot <a href="Danmaku.html" title="Danmaku">danmaku</a>. On stages 5 and 6, they appear to have some kind of <a href="Ghost.html" title="Ghost">ghost</a> theme amongst them because each fairies' entrance on the screen start with spiritual-like material flowing through the screen, then appearing as normal. When defeated, they'll return into their spiritual dwellings and move off the screen.

<p>Fairies again make an appearance in <i><a href="Imperishable_Night.html" title="Imperishable Night">Imperishable Night</a></i>. There are four different coloured fairies that appear over all: blonde hair with a blue dress (stage 1, 3, 4); blonde hair with a red dress; brown hair with a green dress (stage 2); and blue hair with a yellow dress. There are also another version of these fairies in exact appearance with an hat, where they're shown to be more stronger and non-trivial to take care of; they may also have a magic circle around them. Red dress ones appear on stages 2, 3 and 4, green ones appear on stages 1, 3 and 4; and yellow ones appear on stage 3.

<p>Fairies are yet again the common enemy in <i><a href="Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View.html" title="Phantasmagoria of Flower View">Phantasmagoria of Flower View</a></i>, being the primary targets in the game. However, they don't shoot bullets, are extremely easy to destroy by shooting bullets and come in infinity numbers, making <a href="Reimu_Hakurei.html" title="Reimu Hakurei">Reimu Hakurei</a> wonder why there are so many fairies. There are four types of fairies; blue dressed with blonde hair holding a leaf, red dressed with silver hair holding what appears to be a white dandelion with somewhat bigger wings, green dressed with brown hair holding some sunflowers with fairly big wings, and white dressed with blue hair holding two big sunflowers with large wings. The latter is known as the <a href="Sunflower_Fairy.html" title="Sunflower Fairy">Sunflower Fairy</a> and this is their first appearance in the games, along with the former being standardized throughout the rest of the games. Additionally, a fairy named <a href="Cirno.html" title="Cirno">Cirno</a> appeared as a playable character.
</p><p>The fairies come in from the edges of the screen or from the top. Once a fairy is hit, it's defeated, leaving an explosive impact for objects around them (although this does not hurt the player). Shooting one of the fairies in a row usually causes a chain reaction along the entire row. There is one particular fairy that isn't non-trivial to deal with – that being <a href="Lily_White.html" title="Lily White">Lily White</a>. She'll randomly appear on the screen if a fight has gone on for a long time, appearing on both players' fields simultaneously. She will release a large number of large and white bullets before she leaves, which even ZUN says it's "annoying". An EX Attacks appears if she's defeated and she can re-appear.

On <a href="Eiki_Shiki%2c_Yamaxanadu.html" title="Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu">Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu</a>'s stage, the fairies (along with Lily White) are seen dressing like Eiki. <a href="ZUN.html" title="ZUN">ZUN</a> has stated in a Livestream that the fairies and Lily are simply cosplaying as the <a href="Yama.html" title="Yama">yama</a> herself.

These fairies are not trivial to deal with, but Cirno's ability can defeat them quicker. Also, the <a href="Makai.html" title="Makai">Makai</a> sprites of the fairies are re-used from <i><a href="Undefined_Fantastic_Object.html" title="Undefined Fantastic Object">Undefined Fantastic Object</a></i>.

<p>This is the first time when we're adding scores for a completely new game without established scoring standards and goals. I believe we shouldn't add every score out there because: a) they are going to pop up several times a day; b) they aren't necessarily going to be high. And since the page is named "High scores", there is a certain motivation to add scores that actually ARE high. For instance, I added Heartbeam's score because it was on par with Reprise's, and both of them seem to be "high enough", but they are also the first of their kind and we don't yet know what to expect in the future.<br>
This calls for thresholds on scores to be added in order to save time and not clog the replay categories with random replays. So, either we wait some time (a few weeks, probably a month) to let experienced players join in and make initial scoring routes, or think up reference scores to look out for. As such, we empirically "established" that the minimum threshold for Easy seems to be around 900 million so far. Dumbing down the guesswork, I multiplied it by a factor of 1.3 (a relatively safe value partly derived from the difference between trial version records) and got ~1.2 billion for Normal, ~1.5 billion for Hard, and ~2 billion for Lunatic. For Extra, I guess we'll have to go with the first full-spellcard clear. If no-one objects to this plan, this is how I'll be adding new scores. — <a href="User_Moozooh.html" title="User:Moozooh">moozooh</a> 20:17, 17 August 2009 (UTC).
</p>
<dl><dd>I agree. I certainly haven't been uploading every replay I've come across. Basically, I look for the following two characteristics:</dd>
<dd>* All or nearly all spellcards captured</dd>
<dd>* Clear evidence of motivation to advance score (collecting blue UFO pieces, not just red/green ones)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Reprise's 916M Easy fits this description, so I uploaded it. It's clearly improvable, and I think 1 billion+ for Easy is easily attainable. Rather than estimating "safe values," I just watch each replay and inspect its quality manually.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The TH12 score attackers have been a bit slower than for previous TH games...but then again, this installment is the most complex from a scoring perspective, and most error prone (missing one UFO piece could throw off the entire sequence...)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>There is already a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://replay.royalflare.net/replay/th12_uda581.rpy">300M EX replay</a> that misses only one spellcard. It's solid, except that he goes for too many red/rainbow UFOs as opposed to green ones. Obviously, we're not at the point where players are comfortable enough to optimize graze.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I think the "final" WR will be at least 3B for Lunatic and 400M for EX. On St6, by bombing the rows of fairies it's possible to get 700 blue chips * (80,000-100,000 points/chip) * 8.0 UFO multiplier = 448,000,000-560,000,000 points.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><a href="User_Eriksson" title="User:Eriksson">Eriksson</a> 21:53, 17 August 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Personally, I don't think that UFO's scoring system is the most complex to date: there is no end-of-game bonus to speak of, so lives and bombs will generally be sacrificed at every scoring opportunity, and all the critical spots with dense concentration of point and power items are pretty much in-your-face (compared to, say, PCB, which enjoyed something like a dozen new profitable Supernatural Border spots since GIL's landmark replay). Actually, I was surprised to see a replay of Reprise's caliber the second day after the release. On the other hand, grazing and milking UFOs till the last second obviously brings a relatively high degree of execution into the equation, so it probably won't be maxed out as soon as MoF or SA (or IN, if you discount Extra/Lunatic). The problem with exponential scoring systems is that a small improvement early on may result in a drastic net gain in the last couple stages. I'm almost positive the records will eventually go all the way to 1.1–1.2B for Easy, 1.6–1.8B for Normal, 2.2–2.5B for Hard, and at least 3.4B for Lunatic. Heh, I remember the first 2+ billion replays for SA thinking "well, this shouldn't be improvable by that much", and the current WR ended up over twice "that much", with theoretical limit extending to something close to 4.4B. In this context, appraising the replays "manually" doesn't give much of a consistency benefit, but I guess there's no sense in making this as serious a business, either.<br></dd>
<dd>In short, do as you see fit. Myself, I most definitely won't watch every new replay until they stabilize to a degree, so I'll probably stick to my way in those cases. — <a href="User_Moozooh.html" title="User:Moozooh">moozooh</a> 23:13, 17 August 2009 (UTC).</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Proposed_new_replay_format">Proposed new replay format</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="../index6f2c.php?title=Talk:High_scores&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Proposed new replay format">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>Currently the system works like this: (1) download randomly-named replay from Royalflare etc. -&gt; (2) upload replay to Wiki -&gt; (3) link to replay under the parameter THxxReplay
</p><p>Instead, I believe that it would be more efficient if we used standardized names for the replays. For example, the WR replay for TH12, category #03 (Marisa-A on Easy Mode) would *always* be uploaded to Th12_ud1203.rpy. If this record is obsoleted in the future, that new replay would be overwritten to the *same filename*, Th12_ud1203.rpy. I like how Moozooh has been entering replay data (player, score, date) as he uploads them, so there shouldn't be any confusion.
</p><p>Under this system, we can take out the "THxxReplay" parameter in the templates and save a step in updating the records. Another advantage is that we would be able to go down the list, download all the replays, move them to our /replay directory, and they would appear all in order on the user replays screen. This allows for rapid and easy verification.
</p><p>In summary...
</p>
<ul><li>Advantage #1: More efficient; one fewer parameter to update.</li>
<li><strike>Advantage #2: Takes up less space on the wiki server, since obsoleted WR replays are overwritten instead of relocated.</strike></li>
<li>Advantage #3: Downloaded replays would appear in category order on the user replays screen.</li>
<li>You will have to rename the .rpy to the proper name before you upload it.</li></ul>
<p>What do you think? <a href="User_Eriksson" title="User:Eriksson">Eriksson</a> 21:18, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>What I do agree with: advantages #1 and #3. What I don't agree with: overwriting obsolete replay files. Newer replays don't always surpass their predecessors in every way (for instance, omitting certain risky strategies or making mistakes that weren't there before). Some exhibit completely different scoring routes that turn out marginally better than the previous ones result-wise. Either way we might end up losing an important reference. I don't think it would be wise to erase such historic landmarks, when the purpose of uploading the replays in the first place was preserving them so that they would be accessible at any time. I'm afraid I'm against this idea for this reason alone. However, if there is a way to make a single reference page for a category without erasing the entire file backlog associated with it, you have green lights from me. (Also, filespace isn't a concern, really.) — <a href="User_Moozooh.html" title="User:Moozooh">moozooh</a> 21:52, 17 August 2009 (UTC).</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Actually, #2 shouldn't be a problem. If you look at <a href="File_Th12_udTn02.rpy" title="File:Th12 udTn02.rpy">File:Th12 udTn02.rpy</a>, backups of every single revision are stored and downloadable under the "File History" section. So obsoleted replays should still remain intact. <a href="User_Eriksson" title="User:Eriksson">Eriksson</a> 22:27, 17 August 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>All good then. I probably won't take the challenge of renaming and replacing all links myself, though, we should probably do it gradually unless you, <a href="User_Anonymizer" title="User:Anonymizer">Anonymizer</a>, or <a href="User_KyoriAsh.html" title="User:KyoriAsh">KyoriAsh</a> feel like doing it in batches. — <a href="User_Moozooh.html" title="User:Moozooh">moozooh</a> 23:13, 17 August 2009 (UTC).</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I know what you mean, but I not really agree of this proposal. Old replay does deserve to stay as some link are using <code>[[Media:Thxx_udxxxx.rpy]]</code> to direct download the file, so not a good idea, although it does save time to update. Currently, I preserve those previous replay just like in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wiki.thproject.org/index.php?title=%E6%B8%B8%E6%88%8F%E5%BD%95%E5%83%8F">THPWiki's article</a> for users who want to view previous attempt by professional players - <a href="User_KyoriAsh.html" title="User:KyoriAsh">KyoriAsh</a> 07:20, 18 August 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>First, the old replays under udxxxx aren't necessarily being deleted; they can remain intact and so your links would still work. I'm just proposing a "from now on" change...of course, if we switched to this new system, nothing is keeping interested parties from uploading mirrors under udxxxx for the purpose of easy linking (as you seem to be suggesting.) <a href="User_Eriksson" title="User:Eriksson">Eriksson</a> 10:05, 19 August 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>(too many : so I put 1 enough) The "from now on" is doing like Thxx_udRmEA.rpy for Reimu Easy A, udMaEB for Marisa Easy B and etc.? - <a href="User_KyoriAsh.html" title="User:KyoriAsh">KyoriAsh</a> 15:24, 19 August 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>OK, seems new replay format has been implemented, I think I can kill the XXX yyy replay parameter and implement into template, is it OK enough?</dd>
<dd>Meanwhile, using Media or using File prefix? Due to Media prefix can let user straight away download the replay, while File need to go to the article and download it. - <a href="User_KyoriAsh.html" title="User:KyoriAsh">KyoriAsh</a> 08:43, 27 August 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>File, I guess. It allows viewing the entire history of WRs in a category, which I believe is more useful overall compared to single-click download. Although if you implement the changes into the templates at this point, won't that break anything with links following the old format? — <a href="User_Moozooh.html" title="User:Moozooh">moozooh</a> 12:38, 27 August 2009 (UTC).</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Well I can try for Undefined Fantastic Object first, others not in my modify scope. - <a href="User_KyoriAsh.html" title="User:KyoriAsh">KyoriAsh</a> 12:51, 27 August 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>EDIT: OK, have a look on UFO WR template ^^ (well, showing File:xxx a bit not suit my style as I direct use Wiki link)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Why is it showing "File:", actually? I looked at the template code and it has [[File:Th12_udxxxx.rpy|Replay]], shouldn't it show "Replay" instead of the article name? Gah, I wish I was better with wiki markup… — <a href="User_Moozooh.html" title="User:Moozooh">moozooh</a> 13:28, 27 August 2009 (UTC).</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Sad to said that only [[Media:xxx]] support name changing... I revert back to "Replay" since I also not really like the FILE - <a href="User_KyoriAsh.html" title="User:KyoriAsh">KyoriAsh</a> 13:39, 27 August 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Looks great. Thanks for all your hard work.

<p>I.O's UFO Hard Hi-score <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.doujinstg.cn/bbs/read.php?tid=1369&amp;page=6">Link</a>, but not sure which character he used... (BTW, that's my thread of updating High Scores...) - <a href="User_KyoriAsh.html" title="User:KyoriAsh">KyoriAsh</a> 23:21, September 4, 2009 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I've seen that screenshot. I left it unattended because there was no way to update the table with it without knowing what character was used. If I.O doesn't plan on releasing a replay for this score in near future (I guess he wants to improve it first, or something like that), you could try asking him what the character was (I bet it was Sanae-B).</dd>
<dd>Then again, it's not a problem if he won't tell, because we'll likely see a better score within a month or so when the other veterans learn the routes and tricks and start submitting scores. Kagamin is already in the game. — <a href="User_Moozooh.html" title="User:Moozooh">moozooh</a> 01:55, September 6, 2009 (UTC).</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>UFO must have the slowest record progression of any recent TH installment. There isn't even a half-decent (score-wise) Lunatic replay yet and it's been a month since Comiket. I recall that only 2 or 3 days after Subterranean Animism's debut, a 2.5 billion Lunatic replay was posted to royalflare. I wonder what the pros have been doing instead of playing UFO. AM is returning to SA and aiming for 4.3 billion. YASU is still working on Imperishable Night. ASAPIN is nowhere to be found. Suisei-Slime is also nowhere to be found. Et cetera. <a href="Special_Contributions/71.198.178.73" title="Special:Contributions/71.198.178.73">71.198.178.73</a> 05:00, September 15, 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I believe it was somewhat similar in case with Perfect Cherry Blossom (no significant score progress until that one tourney where GIL showcased his famous 2.5 billion replay). One of the problems is that the UFO system requires some route research, and not every world class player opts to copy others' strategies. The other problem is that the game doesn't give you as many extends as earlier installments when played for score. And since most of the important grazing maneuvers aren't done under an invincibility effect, unlike in SA, it puts a lot of pressure on the players on higher difficulties (which might actually be the reason ASAPIN hasn't posted a full run yet). Many of the prominent "breakthrough" players being inactive or busy with jobs at this point is also an important factor, of course. Well, at least ISO is doing a good job with Normal mode.

<p>Did anyone ever bother to check this replay, either here or on Royalflare?  It seems to be broken.  In Stage 5, the player quickly loses all remaining lives during the mid-stage fight with Sakuya.  This happens both with the English-patched EoSD and with the Japanese-language 1.02h version (which I ran using AppLocale).  Royalflare's replay file isn't any different from the one here.
</p><p>The other stages are fine, and I don't have problems with other replays.

<p>As with his 2010/04/21 Easy Reimu-A EoSD replay, this replay also goes out of sync in Stage 5, in this case during the first phases of the main boss fight (first non-spellcard attack and first spellcard). Again, tested by replaying the stage alone and by replaying from the beginning. All the other stages are fine, including Stage 6.

<p>I understand that there is a user on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.thproject.org/">THProject</a> [a Chinese TH community] who has been setting all these new 90M+ EX records...yet does not want his/her replays to be shared with the public. Now, I kinda have an issue with this...the player, of course, has a right to privacy, but I don't think any record without a publicly-viewable replay should be recognised on this site, due to the potential for falsification and abuse. I know this is a touchy issue, so what do the rest of you think? <a href="User_Eriksson" title="User:Eriksson">Eriksson</a> 04:05, August 28, 2010 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I disagree. One of the reasons we've started to list all scores rather than the highest ones is to be a complete reference that doesn't exist elsewhere on the web. Royalflare scores get deleted all the time, many don't even get submitted (many non-clears suffer this fate), some exist only as a screenshot or a mention in a player's blog (like when YASU, Hirona, or AM shot for a high score), some are old enough that the replay doesn't exist or is otherwise inaccessible (I.O scores, and some other ones from 2004–2006). Record credibility is important, but I don't think we should act as a scoreboard institution and enforce strict rules such as the existence of a replay, or take scores down because their author doesn't like them listed here. This is a wiki after all, people don't <i>submit</i> replays here — they <i>list</i> them because somebody somewhere made them and it is important for some players to know about it.</dd>
<dd>What we should still do, however, is check available replays for obvious cheating. For instance, <a href="MSH.html" title="MSH">MSH</a> has been the cause of a scandal a couple years ago (<a href="Talk_High_scores/Archive_1.html#MSH_controversy" title="Talk:High scores/Archive 1">ref</a>), so I don't know if it makes sense to remove a replay verified by a closed community but accept one from a known cheater. In regards to CID's replays, I <i>could</i> try to get a hold of them to verify their authenticity (I post at DoujinSTG from time to time), and I know KyoriAsh should definitely be able to, being a long-time member, so we could probably leave it up to him to verify, but I don't think it's warranted in this case. If I understand the situation right, CID will eventually submit — either after the main Royalflare scoreboard goes up, or until he feels he has hit his limit. — <a href="User_Moozooh.html" title="User:Moozooh">moozooh</a> 08:49, August 28, 2010 (UTC).</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The reason we began archiving replays here was due to all the deletions from Royalflare. The copy of the replay exists to verify the score. On the other hand, accepting occasional screenshots from YASU, AM, and other well-established TH players as validation is okay, because they've proven themselves to be honest people. And in the end they always delivered with public replays of their respective highest scores. But this new player (CID, was it?) I've literally never heard of, and that someone would want to keep a record-breaking replay under wraps just reeks of suspicion to me. <a href="User_Eriksson" title="User:Eriksson">Eriksson</a> 10:16, August 28, 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>"Proven" is kind of overstating it, because, want it or not, we operate under presumption of innocence because it's been possible to cheat at Touhou transparently for pretty much as long as the series exists. We have never <i>seen</i> YASU and AM play, and thus our only proof of their skill is a file that can be tampered with as much as any other one. In fact, repeated suspicion of cheating made AM close his blog earlier this year because his play style is indeed very aggressive (probably the most aggressive compared to the other top-tier players). But we believe him because we have neither a reason to question his abilities nor a possibility to actually check them.</dd>
<dd>As you said, we started archiving replays after the deletions became frequent, but before that we had a scoreboard without replays. Scores were verified (in case they were) by people who have seen the replay. We have a community of people including at least one top-tier player (LYX) who can (and possibly have) done that — what would be the practical difference in this particular sense? That being said, I'll try asking CID for the password, but I'll understand if he won't give it to me before releasing it to the public. — <a href="User_Moozooh.html" title="User:Moozooh">moozooh</a> 11:35, August 28, 2010 (UTC).</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Ok, I asked CID for a password and he PM'd it to me. I've watched the 90 mil replay and it's definitely the real deal: score improvement comes from strategic breakthroughs first and foremost, such as choosing optimal freeze timing/positioning, using the bomb offensively — think EoSD — for huge area coverage (&gt;90% in some cases), and being smart about character's capabilities in general. He reaches level 7 by midboss fight and level 14 by Marisa. There's also potential for improvement, so I'm certain we'll see a 100 million score before the end of the year.</dd>

<dd>I take it there's no way to save the page with upload history and make it easy for us?

<dl><dd>Excuse me, but how does linking back to Wikia make any sense in our current situation, when all the important information should be covered here in one place? Most of the newer replays aren't superior to the ones they supercede in every possible respect. A lot of the obsolete replays contain different strategies and tricks, and are thus important references that aren't readily available elsewhere on the web (which is especially important to scorers; that's not to mention that we track record histories more accurately than Royalflare, where applicable), but downloading and then uploading all of them manually is going to be quite some task, and reverting is going to look ugly. Surely it could be automated at least partially?

<dl><dd>Is there a way to, say, automatically increment a filename so that the main page templates wouldn't contain a manually updated field? I'm thinking of a naming scheme like <i>&lt;mandatory game index&gt;_&lt;category number, 2 chars&gt;&lt;successive number increment, 2 chars&gt;</i> (which would produce a filename like "Th128_0112.rpy" for the 12th replay for category 128-01 for Fairy Wars). It can utilize the redundancy imposed by the game index that has to be there for the game to be able to identify a replay, and will give us more than enough leeway for revisions (at least several hundreds without having to resort to non-alpha-numeric symbols). Part of the reason I really liked the old scheme, though, was that you could save all the replays for one game in its folder, and add all the new ones by overwriting without having to rename anything or look for older files, and it made a nice list in-game.

<p>As the original creator of the high scores page on THWiki I would like to propose adding a section for tool assisted replay. <a href="User_Moozooh.html" title="User:Moozooh">User:Moozooh</a>, one of the early THWiki members who was extremely active in maintaining the high scores page until 2011?, is also a member of TASVideos. Since the development of Hourglass by nitsuja, there has been substantial interest in tool assisted replays for Touhou games. Since Hourglass is still a recent software application, in time all Touhou games will be adequately covered.
</p><p>Each game would have at most 2 categories: Lunatic and Extra/Phantasm, using whichever character has highest score potential. 
</p><p>The criteria for acceptance would be comparable to TASvideos':
</p>
<ul><li>The original replay file must be available (not just a nicovideo recording) and compatible with the original Touhou software application, and must play from start to finish without de-synchronizing.
<ul><li>The only time when a third party software patch would be allowed is to correct an issue related to scoring display, such as in EOSD and UFO, where the program would terminate itself if the score exceeds 999 999 990, due to a bug in the software. Using patches to raise a counter's programmed maximum value (such as increasing graze counter from 9999 to no limit, which affects score multipliers), or adding bullets ("Ultra Mode Patch" etc.) would not be acceptable.</li></ul></li>
<li>The replays must apply strategies that are optimal for score maximisation, and beat all existing records. A replay that is done casually because the player "does not have good enough reflexes to play in real time" is not allowed.</li></ul>
<p>Does anyone have a serious objection to this and if so, what are your reason(s)?
</p><p>Thank you.

<dl><dd>Until Hourglass is refined enough to complete full runs of the recent Touhou games without problems (crashing, inability to save replays in SA onwards), the board is likely to remain incomplete. Since I've already tabulated the records <a href="User_Arcorann/High_Score_Almanac.html" title="User:Arcorann/High Score Almanac">here</a>, I feel that we should wait until this is fixed (which is unlikely in the near future given the lack of development in the past year) before adding the table into the mainspace. <a href="User_Arcorann.html" title="User:Arcorann">Arcorann</a> (<a href="User_talk_Arcorann.html" title="User talk:Arcorann">talk</a>) 01:28, 28 May 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>TASing touhou games is widely available and attractive today is only a good reason for creating a separate page for TAS replays, but not enough for merging TAS and realtime replays together.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>1) People regard the high score page as a reference for improving their skills. Putting TAS replays on top of human replays cannot help.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>2) Human replays and TAS replays are not comparable. So why in the same page? Also, players (especially high score players) may feel uncomfortable about this.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>3) One can hardly convince me that some replay is 'optimal for score maximisation'. I simply do not believe that due to the nature of STG/Touhou games.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>4) Some of the TAS replays uploaded cannot play normally in the japanese version (e.g. th11 5762610660 points), which makes me believe that this entry is not ready to publish.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>My own position is that we can accommodate TAS replays in some way. A TAS run is fundamentally similar to a normal run in that both are competitions of skill - one actual human skill, and one of technical. Both test patience. But they are still different from each other in that one league tests the theoretical limits of inhuman input.</dd>
<dd>TASers have stressed that their competition is entirely separate from the regular ones. Others of noted that, unfortunately, there have been incidents of dishonesty where players submitted TAS runs to regular scoring runs and that this is problematic and that the mere existence of a TAS page may promote this kind of behaviour.</dd>
<dd>Therefore, I think a reasonable compromise is to create an entirely separate article for TAS runs of any kind. Name it "TAS High Scores", "TAS Runs" (if we want to include stuff like MegaMari too), or similar. Put in a disclaimer that "Touhou Wiki does not condone the submission of TAS runs to non-TAS scoreboards." In addition, we should disqualify any TAS run involved with such dishonesty from being submitted to a TAS scoreboard. <a href="User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> (<a href="User_talk_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User talk:Kiefmaster99">talk</a>) 16:33, 28 May 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello!
</p><p>The DDC Trial scoreboard seems odd. Why does it have only one charachter per difficulty?
</p><p>I am sure there is some reason to it, but it just seems odd given how there are scores separated for all shot-types for every other game. Also, having played a bit of DDC it seems that the scoring potential (and playstyle) differs very much depending the chosen shot.
</p><p>I hope it won't cause too much trouble for you if I ask for the reason behind this?
</p>
<dl><dd>Hi. We used to maintain only the highest score in all difficulties/modes together for the trial version (see previous discussions). This time I decided to go one step further. Although it may look weird, I think it is a good choice to balance the users' need and the editors' work (4 entries compared to 1 entry or 4*6 entries). Full 24-entry is too much since the scoreboard for the trial version is only temporary. The game system/scoring pattern may change drastically compared to the full version. Please note that this trial part will be substituted with a full 24-entry table after ver1.00 comes out. <a href="User_Mshearts" title="User:Mshearts">Mshearts</a> (<a href="User_talk_Mshearts" title="User talk:Mshearts">talk</a>) 00:02, 29 May 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Why were a couple of his MoF replays from 2012 not added, and once they were, they got removed afterwards?

<dl><dd>Thanks for updating the replays. The MoF replays are deleted because they are not the correct one (please watch the replays in the game). RoyalFlare's history is not always reliable. Details below if you are interested: for example, if you upload a WR with the name th10_ud1111.rpy, then deleted before the next replay is uploaded, then in the history, th10_ud1111.rpy will point to the new 'th10_ud1111.rpy', which is not the WR replay. On the contrary, if the next replay is uploaded before th10_ud1111.rpy is removed, it will be given a new name th_ud1112.rpy. Then even if the original wr replay is deleted afterwards, the link in the history will still refer to the correct one. <a href="User_Mshearts" title="User:Mshearts">Mshearts</a> (<a href="User_talk_Mshearts" title="User talk:Mshearts">talk</a>) 03:45, 18 November 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>I feel silly for asking this, but after a lot of googling, as well as looking in this wiki, Gensokyo,org, and Royalflare, I still have no idea where Naya's 3.6 billion score is listed, or whether a replay or video is available. I'm interested in where this score came from. Does anyone know?

<p>I'd like to suggest a new guideline (I'm not certain if this is the right place for it): that when a high score is posted, especially without a replay, a link to the score's source be included on the player's page, and if the player doesn't have a page, that one be made for them. It can be difficult or impossible to to locate a specific screenshot or blog post with Google. The most recent WRs (PCB and IN), for example, don't have a source or replay for readers to refer to. Having sources (even if there is a replay), in my opinion, would improve the quality of the score table. <small>—Preceding unsigned comment added by <a href="../indexe601.php?title=User:Cream_Soda&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Cream Soda (page does not exist)">Cream Soda</a> (<a href="User_talk_Cream_Soda" title="User talk:Cream Soda">talk</a> • <a href="Special_Contributions/Cream_Soda" title="Special:Contributions/Cream Soda">contribs</a>) 28 September 2014‎ 9:44 (UTC)</small>

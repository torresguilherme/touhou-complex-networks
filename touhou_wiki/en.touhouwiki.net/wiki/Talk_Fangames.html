<p>Not a character cameo, but I think it counts in spirit:
The second Tiger Dojo extra skit (after getting 20 Tiger Stamps) is a brief danmaku battle between Rin and Sakura, complete with a fake stage introduction and spellcards. I guess it's because TYPE-MOON <i>was</i> a doujin circle before going commercial.

<p>We really need to do something about this section. I came in here to add a game that wasn't on the list and had a hard time just trying to add something. It's really cluttered and the pages are all over the place it seems. The summaries are unstructured and everything.
</p><p>For starters, maybe we could have like a table that will organize the information like they have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_video_games" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of open-source video games">here</a>.
</p><p>Eventually, we should come up with some standard categories for each game itself, such as an "Overview" and maybe "System Info" and "Gameplay". The idea here is that it doesn't matter what type of game it is, a game in the end is just a game and everything about the game can be described and categorized accordingly.
</p><p>Currently some of the pages use the Infobox Touhou template, which looks pretty good. But we can probably go further and define further guidelines to use. --<a href="User_Tsukihime.html" title="User:Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a> 17:34, 26 December 2010 (PST)

<p>Now it appears that articles about games are named randomly. Some of them are in romaji, some in Japanese kana/kanji. I think this thing should be unificated. While we have article about official game  named as Touhou Hisoutensoku not 東方非想天則, I propose to rename all Japanese spelled articles into romaji. --<a href="User_Coyc.html" title="User:Coyc">Coyc</a> 16:00, 27 December 2010 (PST)
</p>
<dl><dd>I'd say all of the articles should be romanji simply because it is much easier to type/read for the vast majority of the audience; myself included. The only problem is that the romanji is rarely included with the game and I don't have the necessary Japanese knowledge to write the romanji for a game if I were to add a bunch of games to the list from Operation Jaguar or something else. -- <a href="User_Qazmlpok.html" title="User:Qazmlpok">Qazmlpok</a> 17:45, 27 December 2010 (PST)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>My idea is to have both the original name as well as the english (or romanized, if english is unavailable) name. For search purposes, it would be easier. For sure we should HAVE romanizations or translations for every title so that people can actually read it/say it. --<a href="User_Tsukihime.html" title="User:Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a> 17:57, 27 December 2010 (PST)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Can somebody clarify the protocol for the games' <b>page names</b>? As far as I observed, these are the manner that's applied:<br>
1). Generally, the pages will be named by their full name (i.e. including the subtitle).<br>
</p>
<dl><dd>Exception of rule 1): <b>BUT</b>, if the title is named in the same format as the official works, meaning "Japanese main-title with English subtitle" (e.g. 東方夢終劇 ～ Concealed the Conclusion), the page will only have the English subtitle (e.g. in this case "Concealed the Conclusion".)</dd>
<dd>Question: How do deal with the ones like "夢幻 -Spell of mirage- ～桜華～"? And another one: for the "English main title with Japanese subtitle" what will we do (e.g. "ENDLESS ALICE ～七色魔法使い危機一髪！～")?</dd></dl>
<p>2). All Japanese have to be romazied.<br>
</p>
<dl><dd>Exception of rule 2): For the English borrowed words that are written in hiragana/katakana, respell them out as English (e.g. 東方スカイアリーナ to "Touhou Sky Area" not "Touhou Sukai Ariina"). This also applies to the compound words, like ダイナマリサ３Ｄ -&gt; DynaMarisa 3D (BTW, this game's page is named as "<a href="DynaMarisa.html" class="mw-redirect" title="DynaMarisa">DynaMarisa</a>", where did the "3D" go?)<br></dd>
<dd>Exception of rule 2)-2: If the developer had provided an alternative title in English or English loaned Japanese words, use it (e.g. 魔理沙と6つのキノコ -&gt; New Super Marisa Land, 東方武闘外伝[とうほうばとるがいでん] -&gt; Touhou Battle Gaiden).<br></dd></dl>
<p>3). For avoiding miscellaneous translation related problems, NEVER translate the Japanese words in the name of the page.<br>
If these rules look okay, then I want to convert the page name that doesn't apply to these rules. --<a href="User_Doncot.html" title="User:Doncot">Doncot</a> (<a href="User_talk_Doncot.html" title="User talk:Doncot">talk</a>) 14:34, 30 July 2012 (UTC)
</p>

<li>Use translation if <b>NO</b> English subtitle name.</li>
<li>Should be full name.</li></ol></dd>

<dd>Just in case you haven't got the right message, these are rules for <b>page's name</b> okay? Because I don't think that second rule is a sensible option; like I've said translating on page names cause problems like inconsistency per editors and may raise disputes over wording of the translation (unlike official song names, I don't think it's really necessary to translate them). Besides, almost all of the pages' names now are written in romaji already. Other than that it looks good, since they're basically just saying the same thing I've said. --<a href="User_Doncot.html" title="User:Doncot">Doncot</a> (<a href="User_talk_Doncot.html" title="User talk:Doncot">talk</a>) 15:24, 30 July 2012 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Seconding this concern. Do we have to include the romaji when it's literally just pronunciation of hiragana? The title "ぐるぐるすいか" for example is simply "Guruguru Suika" (meaning Spinning Suika, I think). This page's Title section has a mix of untranslated, translated and romaji titles for <i>redlinked</i> games (those without pages yet), so I wasn't sure how to change this.<a href="User_Anomaly.html" title="User:Anomaly">Anomaly</a> (<a href="User_talk_Anomaly.html" title="User talk:Anomaly">talk</a>) 20:45, 11 August 2012 (EDT)
<dl><dd>Many pages haven't been applied to these rules yet (not to mention these rules are not fully established yet too...). Anyway, frankly I don't understand your concern. Basically, the rules are saying that if the title is in and only in Japanese script, make the page in romaji (thus, ぐるぐるすいか-&gt;"Guruguru Suika"). It's simple as that.--<a href="User_Doncot.html" title="User:Doncot">Doncot</a> (<a href="User_talk_Doncot.html" title="User talk:Doncot">talk</a>) 20:58, 11 August 2012 (EDT)</dd>
<dd>I was confused because some have actual translations (洩矢の旅～I wanna be the God -&gt; Moriya's Journey), despite it not being official (I think?) and others have just romaji.

</p><p>Not really that much of a gamer, but here are some quick Wikipedia inspired summaries:
</p>
<ul><li>Beat 'em up - Fight multitudes of enemies, usually in close combat. Beat boss at end of level. Go to next level and repeat. Related to the Hack and Slash, which has a bigger emphasis on weapons.</li>
<li>Card - Card battle games like Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh, or the Pokemon trading card game.</li>
<li>Danmaku - Dodge bullets and shoot bullets. Touhou.</li>
<li>Fighting - One-on-one fighting. Street Fighter, King of Fighters, the Touhou fighters, etc.</li>
<li>Platformer - Mario, Castlevania, basically anything with platforms.</li>
<li>Puzzle - Solve puzzles. Really broad genre.</li>
<li>Racing - Race to the track finish!</li>
<li>Rhythm - DDR.</li>
<li>RPG - Level up your party characters by fighting monsters and gaining experience and new skills! Complete quests! Follow the story line! Final Fantasy, etc.</li>
<li>Seihou - A series.</li>
<li>Sports - Anything involving sports.</li>
<li>Strategy - "Strategy video games focus on gameplay requiring careful and skillful thinking and planning in order to achieve victory." Kind of broad, but includes real-time (Starcraft), turn-based (Advance Wars), 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate) like Civilization, or even tower defense.</li>
<li>Tactical RPG - Turn-based strategy game meets the individual character aspect of the RPG. Fire Emblem, Super Robot Wars. There should be more of these. O_O</li>
<li>Flash - Flash games. Can be any genre, really.</li>
<li>Visual Novel - Walls of text and lots of story, but with pictures! Like a choose your own adventure (or not) illustrated storybook. Can be like a dating sim, with multiple routes/girls/ends. Sengoku Gensokyo is interesting because it's a "conquest simulation" game, whatever that means.</li></ul>
<p>As for new categories, I'm not sure Tower Defense should really be lumped with Strategy, but it's a very small category so I suppose it's fine.

<p>Right now the games for each category are for the most part randomly ordered without any clear pattern (save game sequels, and not even all of those are grouped together). Should we perhaps change the default ordering to be based on Publisher, Release Date, Popularity, Name, etc? None of these really work, but almost anything would be better than what we have now. Thoughts please. <font face="Comic Sans MS"><a href="User_Pufferfish101.html" title="User:Pufferfish101">Pufferfish</a><sup><a href="User_talk_Pufferfish101.html" title="User talk:Pufferfish101">101</a></sup></font> 21:59, 1 January 2011 (PST)
</p>
<dl><dd>I've had the same concern. I think rearrangement depending on date would be pretty useful. As for the sequels, if people are looking for a sequel to a certain game, all they have to do is look under the date when that game was released (since a sequel would be released after the original one so the sequel would not be placed above the original). Still if the sequel issue takes priority, then probably ordering by title would be more efficient (since sequels usually share names, don't they?) <a href="User_Deathsoul4.html?title=User:Deathsoul4&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Deathsoul4 (page does not exist)">Deathsoul4</a> 23:07, 1 January 2011 (PST)</dd>
<dd>Just some clearing up: By sharing names I mean sequels sometimes have similar names (like the Harry Potter Series). Also if we'd go by arrangement by title, then I'd suggest arranging in order of romanization, since many of the titles are in Japanese, and if the game title is already in English, then we can just go by that English title. <a href="User_Deathsoul4.html?title=User:Deathsoul4&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Deathsoul4 (page does not exist)">Deathsoul4</a> 23:10, 1 January 2011 (PST)
<dl><dd>Ya, there was some agreement on sorting by romanized title, and then japanese title (of course, that probably means randomly throw it at the end). When the page was re-designed I was supposed to order them by name. Didn't really get to it though lol. I would think sequels would be ordered correctly regardless whether we sort it by date or title. Anyways since all of the entries are uniform I can probably amuse myself by coming up with some script where you just copy all of the entry templates and it'll output them based on the specified sorting scheme (translated title, release year, etc.) --<a href="User_Tsukihime.html" title="User:Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a> 23:24, 1 January 2011 (PST)
<dl><dd>You know what would be really great? If we could just take the sorting script that was made for the table and just use it to re-order the entries. Saves so much time :| --<a href="User_Tsukihime.html" title="User:Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a> 14:44, 3 January 2011 (PST)
<dl><dd>The table is set up as sortable; at the click of a button you can re-order it by title, language, publisher, release, and description. Which is honestly rather silly; it should be possible to modify the table to only allow sorting by title and release; sorting by description is meaningless, publisher I can't see much use for, and language is misleading.</dd>
<dd>If you really want to manually sort it somehow, I would recommend sorting it by date released but giving special preference to sequels. So TPW, TPW EVO, and EVO+ should all be next to each other despite the time difference between their releases. Just how I'd do it. -- <a href="User_Qazmlpok.html" title="User:Qazmlpok">Qazmlpok</a> 15:19, 3 January 2011 (PST)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>So... I has this idea, browsing some of the pages of Touhou games developers. Since they have kinda similar style while making their games, it would be logic actually to create links to a page, that would give a list of games they produced. Some pages are made already, some have only links to the developer's page, most have nothing.... It might be handy, but might be not, since you just need to go to their page, where you can get all the info you want. <a href="User_Berzul.html" title="User:Berzul">Berzul</a> 15:04, 18 June 2011 (UTC)
</p><p>Well the idea evolved, What I want to know really, if what do you think people want from this page? I find it just a general database of possible leads, maybe there will be no videos on Youtube, but on Nico there is plenty more than just games from here. On that note, I think we should discuss just that, should we actually change or add somekind of division of these games, not only by genre, but by circles, or releases (As in "released at Rentaisai")? <a href="User_Berzul.html" title="User:Berzul">Berzul</a> 06:24, 27 June 2011 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I wouldn't mind being able to search by different criteria, but it would seem difficult to implement on a wiki.

<dl><dd>That "example" page looks decent. Regardless, I'd prefer "sorted by publishers" with a "genre column" on the table tough, since I check games via publisher names and not by genre (I guess this depends on each people's taste, so this is just an opinion). Also I think the language column needs to indicate whether if it's unofficial or not (like adding "(U)" at the end). And can we change the "year" to "year/month"? Since there are many games that are published at the same year. --<a href="User_Doncot.html" title="User:Doncot">Doncot</a> (<a href="User_talk_Doncot.html" title="User talk:Doncot">talk</a>) 23:30, 20 July 2012 (UTC)
<dl><dd>A few things I'd like to say:
<ol><li>All of the games on the example page and each of the proposed subpages are of just one genre (platformers on the example page). I didn't include the publishers in the table since I thought that would make it more or less identical to what we currently have (and thus defeat the purpose of refactoring/redesigning). (A genre column would be useful if the table will be used on the publishers' pages.)</li>
<li>"Unofficial" as in "not the original language"? (Not sure if that's what you intended.)</li>
<li>I have no problem adding the month with the year. I was only working with the info that was already given, which doesn't include the month. (Also keep in mind that going through all the entries to add the months will involve a lot of searching and researching.)</li></ol></dd>

I like to suggest on creating a new article called "Unrelated games". <span lang="ja">～</span> <a href="User_Tony64.html" title="User:Tony64">Tony64</a> <sup>(<a href="User_talk_Tony64.html" title="User talk:Tony64">Talk</a>/<a href="Special_Contributions/Tony64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tony64">Con.</a>)</sup> 15:42, 20 February 2012 (UTC)

<dl><dd>For some games it is indeed just made by fans of Touhou, rather than the producer itself. For example: MUGEN, Team Fortress or GTA. They all may be separated indeed. ☢ <a href="User_Quwanti.html" title="User:Quwanti">Quwanti</a> 15:58, 20 February 2012 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Do they warrant another page dedicated to them? While calling them Fangames would be a bit of a misnomer, calling them "Unrelated" is worse, as is splitting. All games still incorporate a Touhou element. The main difference is that the mods are built upon another existing game, which is more of a technical thing. When incorporating a mod, it still plays much like most other Touhou fangames. <a href="User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> 17:07, 20 February 2012 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Then we could keep those "mods" in this fangames article but put them in another section of this article, probably under the name that Kyo suggested. --<b>This message from <a href="User_Deathsoul4.html?title=User:Deathsoul4&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Deathsoul4 (page does not exist)">DeltaSierra4</a> was delivered on</b> 18:58, 20 February 2012 (UTC)

<p>I know making each page takes some work, but there are too many red links on this page. Leaving a page uncreated should only be a temporary measure and not a permanent one. If the editor wants to add an article, then s/he should at least make a page with the Infobox and a brief description. All those eye-hurting red links are just getting in the way of looking in the page without giving much useful information. If nobody is going to do something, I'd love to delete those links, or at least unlink them to get rid of the red. --<a href="User_Doncot.html" title="User:Doncot">Doncot</a> (<a href="User_talk_Doncot.html" title="User talk:Doncot">talk</a>) 23:53, 20 July 2012 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Well, the only thing I can said: non-english wiki <b>MORE RED LINKS!</b> - <a href="User_KyoriAsh.html" title="User:KyoriAsh">KyoriAsh</a> (<a href="User_talk_KyoriAsh.html" title="User talk:KyoriAsh">talk</a>) 14:47, 21 July 2012 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Adding blank pages would just make it even more difficult to find useful information. The red link means that no page exists and thus no information is available. If you create an empty page, then there is <b>still</b> no information available, but it makes it look like there is some. Even just adding an infobox is of little help, since the title and circle is already listed on this page.</dd>
<dd>Please don't delete any links just because the page doesn't exist. That is almost guaranteeing that the page will never exist. -- <a href="User_Qazmlpok.html" title="User:Qazmlpok">Qazmlpok</a> (<a href="User_talk_Qazmlpok.html" title="User talk:Qazmlpok">talk</a>) 18:54, 21 July 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>First of all, since I'm receiving some oppositions I'm not going to make a move unless we make a consensus, so don't worry about that.<br>
Anyway,<br>
&gt;non-english wiki <b>MORE RED LINKS!</b><br>
Even the second largest zh-wiki is like six times smaller than the en-wiki with so less editors (which I think isn't a new news for you), so I don't think we can even start to compare them.<br>
&gt;That is almost guaranteeing that the page will never exist.<br>
Well frankly speaking, that is actually what I intend. If the editor feels the need s/he can always re-add the page by her/him self, if the page doesn't get updated, then I believe it consequently concludes that that it wasn't a big deal to begin with. Remember that this is just <b>fan</b>game  page, so we don't need to add ALL of the games regardless of how major or minor they are, unlike the official work pages. I mean in terms of game titles by numbers, this page has already outnumbered the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/東方二次創作ゲーム">Nicopedia's Touhou fangames page</a> (which link coverage is more than 80%). Not to mention that minor and old games will soon be out of stock, so <i>supposedly</i> there shouldn't be new players that will need the information to begin with when it gets outdated like in a month or so (just pointing it out). In the end, I'm just saying that doesn't the editor need to work a little more harder when adding new items? The fanmusic page's link coverage looks more than 80%, why can't it be done here too?--<a href="User_Doncot.html" title="User:Doncot">Doncot</a> (<a href="User_talk_Doncot.html" title="User talk:Doncot">talk</a>) 22:12, 21 July 2012 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Pages aren't created because it's more work than people are willing to put into it. The music pages are fleshed out because there's a lot more people listening to music than playing fangames.</dd>
<dd>Deleting links doesn't add anything to the wiki. I honestly don't see what the benefit of doing it would be. If I come for <a href="Sanae_Challenge%21_FUSION.html" title="Sanae Challenge! FUSION">Sanae Challenge! FUSION</a>, I can currently at least see that another game (Sanae Challenge) exists, even if the page has no content. Some information is better than no information, in my opinion.</dd>
<dd>New players can find old games just as easily as new people can find old albums. Age is no reason to purge items from the list. -- <a href="User_Qazmlpok.html" title="User:Qazmlpok">Qazmlpok</a> (<a href="User_talk_Qazmlpok.html" title="User talk:Qazmlpok">talk</a>) 23:43, 21 July 2012 (UTC)
<dl><dd>The purpose of my suggestion was to clarify up this page, since it's getting harder and harder to find the games you (I) want to find because of some vague data (there are games that don't even have a publisher name). <b>At least</b>, can't we disable the links? The red links look to me as if they're in the middle of the progress and the editor has <i>some</i> intention of making a page, or is there a rule that we always need to link them up on this wiki? (I would want this rule to be applied on the fanmusic section too for the same reason)--<a href="User_Doncot.html" title="User:Doncot">Doncot</a> (<a href="User_talk_Doncot.html" title="User talk:Doncot">talk</a>) 00:49, 22 July 2012 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I interpret an editor adding a red link as "I feel this page should exist", not "I plan on creating this page". I take this assumption for any page on any wiki, as well; not just this page or this wiki. If you are having trouble finding something specific, I recommend using your browser's search functionality. -- <a href="User_Qazmlpok.html" title="User:Qazmlpok">Qazmlpok</a> (<a href="User_talk_Qazmlpok.html" title="User talk:Qazmlpok">talk</a>) 01:50, 22 July 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

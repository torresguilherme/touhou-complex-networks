<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Main_page_layout_update">Main page layout update</span></h2>
<p>Hullo! I am <a href="../User_Kirkburn" title="User:Kirkburn">Kirkburn</a>, your friendly local Wikia Gaming Helper!
</p><p>Hopefully you have read about the skin and ad changes at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikia%27s_New_Style" class="extiw" title="w:Wikia's New Style">Wikia's New Style</a> on Central Wikia. If not, I hope you'll have a look.  
</p><p>One of the changes is a block of two ads on each main page. It's possible that they won't always show up, but to ensure your main page continues to work properly when they do, you need to update your main page column formatting code with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c:help:Help:Main_page_column_tags" class="extiw" title="w:c:help:Help:Main page column tags">new column tags</a>.
</p><p>I have drafted a main page using the new tags on <a href="../User_Kirkburn/Dev" title="User:Kirkburn/Dev">User:Kirkburn/Dev</a> which I hope you can take a look at - feel free to make a copy and edit it. Though the layout may seem restrictive at first, there really is a fair amount you can do with them - for example see these customized main pages - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c:muppet" class="extiw" title="w:c:muppet">Muppet Wiki</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c:wowwiki" class="extiw" title="w:c:wowwiki">WoWWiki</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c:ffxi" class="extiw" title="w:c:ffxi">FFXIclopedia</a>. You may want to chat with your wiki community about what direction to take with a new main page.
</p><p>If you encounter any problems with the new tags, please <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Kirkburn" class="extiw" title="w:User talk:Kirkburn">let us know</a>.
</p><p>My apologies for any inconvenience these changes bring.<br>

The letter between Japanese &amp; English words is "～" (fullwidth tilde), not "〜" (wave dash). Normally Japanese people don't use or see a wave dash, because a Japanese version of keyboard don't have a key of wave dash, but fullwidth dash (shift+^).

<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www16.big.or.jp/~zun/html/game.html">ZUN's</a> manner is to put a period, or full stop, at the end of each title.

I don't think English manner is bad, but what is the criterion? We're spelling the name at the index name as ZUN spellt in PMiSS and setting memos, regardless of how in body text. It shows we're to spell as ZUN does, then why is the current top page is like that? --Masuo64 13:06, 19 January 2009 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I had it in my head that that had ended as of "Mountain of Faith," but I looked into it, and discovered that you're right.  I just checked Zun's blog announcement for UFO, and even today, he still uses periods in his titles.  Though, as far as I'm aware, the only actual title <i>screen</i> to use a period is that of "Immaterial and Missing Power."  All others are bereft of periods, if I recall correctly (probably because of the style of the typefaces the titles are written in, I'd wager).  If it were a personal call on my part, I'd say not to worry about a period (as opposed to, say, apostrophes or commas, whose placement I'd be far more worried about), and I'd even suggest against it, as in my opinion titles with periods look awkward and strange.  However, I can't make that call.  But I couldn't tell you which way to call it, either, as I don't know which way he'd say it's official.  Can anyone provide more insight?--<a href="../User_AceOfHeartsDX.html" title="User:AceOfHeartsDX">AceOfHeartsDX</a> 02:19, November 8, 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Suggestion_that_we_add_more_categories">Suggestion that we add more categories</span></h2>
<p>Each official title has its particular pages; for example, Story, Strategy, Character, Spell Card, which Wikipedia is likely to have but touhou wiki doesn't have.  Now I want to suggest to you that we make new categories. The categories of my idea are like this:<br>
1. Official works: Official Game, Offcial CD, Offcial Book.<br>
2. Things about official works: Game Play, Story, Character, Music, Strategy, Miscellaneous. Perhaps it's needed to add Frame Data, Netplay to them.<br>
3. Doujin works: Doujin Game, Doujin Book, Doujin CD. (But I suspect we have difficulty of making these categories because of the enormous number...)<br>
These may be a little short, but we can make new categories except these. At least, the categories of official works are necessary, I believe. --Masuo64 12:54, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Maybe we should add categories separating doujin circles that do manga from anthologies. That way, we could categorize which doujin circles participated in which anthologies. <a href="../User_Jigglyppuff8.html" title="User:Jigglyppuff8">jpp8</a> 19:53, October 19, 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>In truth, almost no native English speakers can read that system lol...  I notice drake uploaded a sound file, which could work, or we could make a small guide for pronouncing Japanese (just how to sound out the vowels should be enough) like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Japanese#Japanese_pronunciation" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Help:Japanese">wiki system</a>.  <a href="../User_Oreng3" title="User:Oreng3">Oreng3</a> 09:38, 16 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Using aquestalk, a TTS software, we can make an approximate sound like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/touhou/images/f/f3/Heroins.ogg">this</a>. Do you suggest we upload such a sound file &amp; make a link to it? --Masuo64 17:12, 16 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I was actually just thinking of uploading voice clips from people who can actually speak instead of a program. I have 20 different names ready to put up, and more if possible. Wikipedia has a a bunch of functions that might work, but it doesn't look like Touhouwiki has any of these options. How would one go about putting them up?

</p>
<dl><dd>Excuse me, Drake. But, are you a native Japanese? From your pronunciation I guess you're non-native, because <a href="../../images/a/a0/Suika.ogg" class="internal" title="Suika.ogg">Your uploaded file</a> has stress accent, while Japanese language has pitch accent. As a trial, what do you think about My uploaded file, <a href="../../images/1/11/Suika2.ogg" class="internal" title="Suika2.ogg">Suika</a> &amp; <a href="../../images/1/1f/Sanae2.ogg" class="internal" title="Sanae2.ogg">Sanae</a>? --Masuo64 13:56, 18 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Aha, no, I'm not. I'm Canadian. Actually, I haven't even taken any classes. The only references I have for accents is neckbreak-pace stuff, which is hard to figure. It's like trying to learn a french accent from a Quebecois; doesn't work. I can see how mine and yours differ, though, which is definitely a plus. I just have a problem with the dullness in your voice, no offense~  <a href="../User_Drake_Irving.html" title="User:Drake Irving">Drake</a> 18:38, 18 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Hmm, I've never realized my pronunciation is dull. But my pronunciation is unclear, and my environment might not fit to record, my ogg file hasn't enough quality. So, you might as well go ahead, Drake. --Masuo64 10:13, 19 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Maybe we should use aquestalk, instead, like you suggested.  Or, although I don't know if other people would like it, using the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://cncc.hp.infoseek.co.jp/">softalk</a> ("yukkuri") voice might be amusing... <a href="../User_Oreng3" title="User:Oreng3">Oreng3</a> 04:19, 21 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Softalk doesn't work, because softalk isn't able to make the sound with the high accent on the first syllable. Aquestalk had better be used. Well... Tomorrow or the day's after tomorrow afternoon, I'll record again my voice for many characters of Japanese, European, &amp; Chinese names, taking attention for volume &amp; pronunciation. (Will do at least Japanese pronunciation. My English pronunciation might be bad, but I'll record. If that's not OK... I'll think at the time.) If those recorded file aren't worth using, I'll prepare the sound file with aquestalk (Japanese pronunciation) for many characters of Japanese, European, &amp; Chinese names. So, wwit a moment please... --Masuo64 16:05, 21 April 2009 (UTC)
</p><p>Added sound files of EoSD characters at first. What I must say is; thank you, Drake. My English pronunciation is much worse than what I expected... And particularly your French sound brighten Flandre with the echo of French sound. Very good quality. Next, I'll go to PCB's characters. But, sleepy now. Good night... --Masuo64 16:55, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

<dl><dd><i>Moved to <a href="../Touhou_Wiki_talk_Copyrights.html" title="Touhou Wiki talk:Copyrights">Touhou Wiki talk:Copyrights</a></i></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Spoilers_in_the_Wiki_September_2009">Spoilers in the Wiki September 2009</span></h2>
<p>Because this issue is coming up (and understandably so) time and again, I propose that information, text, or pictures that one could only know from seeing an ending by beating a game should be removed and restricted as encountered.
</p><p>So if info from a previous game's ending becomes available as it is mentioned in a future game's playthrough, it will become legit.
</p><p>So that Suwako had Kappa helping her is dialogue from Sanae's Th12.3 Scenario that comes before beating it and seeing the ending, that info can be present.
</p><p>But for people who are getting into Touhou, and because similar to Wikipedia, there are no spoiler tags here as far as I can see, but because visitors will come in the midst of playing through a Touhou game, it would be inconsiderate to have spoilers as described above. 
</p><p>I haven't had a chance to play through UFO yet, but from reading the tidbits here it's been spoiled for me. That's obviously not a big deal, but given the volume of visitors, particularly near a release date or after a release, a mass of spoilage, whether it be a picture or text conveying info only knowable from seeing an ending, should be given due consideration, and I believe, removed or restricted. I hope as with the romanization discussion that others will weigh in to either change or preserve whatever the current policy is.    <a href="../User_TheTrueBlue.html" title="User:TheTrueBlue">TheTrueBlue</a> 16:14, September 6, 2009 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I was initially under the impression that ZUN had changed his policy regarding use of his materials. After the regular translators had another look at it it was apparent that ZUN in fact had <i>not</i> changed his policy since 2 years ago, thus I see no reason to change the consensus regarding spoilers we've allays adhered to.</dd>
<dd>A "Here be spoilers" on the main page however is something that escaped implementation for some reason, fixing it now.--<a href="../User_Umhyuk.html" title="User:Umhyuk">Umhyuk</a> 16:39, September 6, 2009 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Or we can use spoiler warnings or hide spoilers somehow with code. We don't need to follow what Wikipedia does. My reading of ZUN's guideline certainly doesn't bar the discussion of ending material. <a href="../User_Deadkid_dk.html" title="User:Deadkid dk">_dk</a> 22:25, September 6, 2009 (UTC)
<dl><dd>By discussing do you mean posting about endings in forums? Or openly permitting text that reveals things only knowable if one were to see an ending to be inserted anywhere in articles here on Touhou wiki. The first is obviously true and permissible and widespread, the second might be troubling for reasons I previously posted.</dd>
<dd>Spoiler code is an excellent idea, and one that's widely implemented on countless forums. That would work beautifully.</dd>
<dd>Unfortunately I think one has to be an admin to add or remove code permissions? Unless Touhou wiki already had such a feature?</dd>
<dd><a href="../User_TheTrueBlue.html" title="User:TheTrueBlue">TheTrueBlue</a> 22:58, September 6, 2009 (UTC)
<dl><dd>The second point is what I'm talking about. Well, but if you agree with the spoiler code idea then I guess this issue is settled. We can have spoilers that can be seen only when highlighted <span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #000000">like this</span>. Or revealed on mouseover, whatever works. <a href="../User_Deadkid_dk.html" title="User:Deadkid dk">_dk</a> 23:32, September 6, 2009 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Yes, the highlight option looks pretty good, just a standard "Spoiler: <span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #000000">Spoiler goes here</span>" .</dd>
<dd>Now everything that reveals something one could only see from beating a Touhou game and seeing an ending; that's further not revealed in a future game, will ideally have "Spoiler: <span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #000000">Spoiler goes here</span>". To protect the unwary. <a href="../User_TheTrueBlue.html" title="User:TheTrueBlue">TheTrueBlue</a> 00:07, September 7, 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>(unindent) I've made a simple template that makes hiding text easier, <span title="Spoiler" class="t_hidetext">like this</span>, invoked by {{hidetext|insert spoiler here}}. There also is a little-used template {{spoiler}} that makes this appear:
</p>
<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler" style="border-top: 2px solid #dddddd; border-bottom:2px solid #dddddd; text-align: justify; margin: 1em; padding: 0.2em;"><font color="Red"><b>Spoiler Warning: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow</i></b></font></div>
<p>Though I don't know how we can use this. <a href="../User_Deadkid_dk.html" title="User:Deadkid dk">_dk</a> 00:57, September 7, 2009 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>The spoiler code idea is good, but I wouldn't even consider "X is in Y's ending" to <i>be</i> a spoiler in the first place, unless Y was thought to be dead or something. --<a href="../User_TheSinnerChrono.html" title="User:TheSinnerChrono">TheSinnerChrono</a> 01:03, September 7, 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Well I think it can get tricky making those kinds of calls and proposed the above criteria - As long as it's something you'd have to see an ending to know. It can be considered a spoiler. So knowing that character A makes an appearance in character B's ending, being something only revealed when you see an ending, fits into this category. Of course this kind of info is less harmful than something spoilerific like RON MARRIES HERMONIE, but although it's for those kinds of possible disasters that I hope this system will come in handy, there are also lesser threats that it could help with. It couldn't hurt, simply having to highlight something. <a href="../User_TheTrueBlue.html" title="User:TheTrueBlue">TheTrueBlue</a> 01:09, September 7, 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>It's kinda disturbing... like censored or so. Why do we had to censored about the extra ending since it's writed on the scripts. -<a href="../User_Dandan550.html" title="User:Dandan550">Dandan550</a> 02:02, September 7, 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Well, to get to extra in the first place, you have to beat the game. Since you can't know anything about the extra stages until you beat the main game first, those can technically be considered spoilers...

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I don't think that could be implemented too easily. Extra stages involve gameplay and not the picture+text format that Touhou endings have always been delivered as. Besides, who could play through a Touhou danmaku game and NOT at least beat extra.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Concerning_whether_GoM_is_spelt_in_katakana_or_alphabet">Concerning whether GoM is spelt in katakana or alphabet</span></h2>
<p>There's an edit of the top page to fix the title of "The Grimoire of Marisa" into "グリモワール・オブ・マリサ". Yes, this is a puzzling thing. Maybe everybody can't say at first which is original.<br>
My conclusion is it's better in latin alphabet: The one reason is because there are "グリモワール・オブ・マリサ" just on the spine and "Grimoire of Marisa" or "The Grimore of Marisa" on the other parts (frontcover, backcover, pg.1, and pg.168). And the other reason is even if we coundn't help but see that the spine of book appears to be the essence, or what we see at the most time of all parts of book, because <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/Grimoire-Marisa-グリモワール-マリサ-DNAメディアブックス/dp/4758011524">Amazon.jp</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grimoire_of_Marisa">ja.wikipedia.org</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.shop.ichijinsha.co.jp/book/booksearch/booksearch_detail.php?i=75801152">publisher's web site</a> use it. --Masuo64 13:03, 29 August 2009 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>So Masuo64, you are proposing that the English title: "The Grimoire of Marisa" should currently be used, but that the katakana "グリモワール・オブ・マリサ" should not at all be used? Is that right? I just to make sure I understand what you wrote.</dd>
<dd>Well, it works either way I suppose, just seemed strange that with all the lovely Japanese titles on the left side of the main page in "Games" and "Print Works", that this one English-only title stuck out like an ugly sore thumb. But if neither Zun nor his partners in this project have officially granted a Japanese title to the work, then I suppose to add one otherwise would be reprehensible. <a href="../User_TheTrueBlue.html" title="User:TheTrueBlue">TheTrueBlue</a> 13:09, 29 August 2009 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Your understanding is right, TheTrueBlue. There are more proofs for using alphabet than katakana. And, indeed, as you write, it looks bad for the inconsistent line of titles due to the only one title name. But it looks a bit bad if we write it in katakana, since the other titles are 東方XXX like 東方香霖堂 and GoM doesn't follow the way of naming.<br></dd>
<dd>We can also say that ZUN doesn't care about non-Japanese environment and culture or that it might be the implicit explanation: pick up ZUN's works which don't follow the form "東方○○○　〜 XXX" (○ is kanji, almost all are 3 letters except PMiSS. XXX is an English phrase). Probably they are seen as side stories or no main stories: Akyu's untouched Score series (the story is quite short and brief in it than in Hifuu Club's CD), Tsuki no Inaba to Chijou no Inaba (many settings contradict those of the shooting game), the Grimoire of Marisa (it hasn't story, setting text and conversation), and Hisoutensoku (ZUN said on twitter that this is a side story, ). Um, anyway, my opinion is we follow the way of "Grimoire of Marisa", not "グリ... マリサ" because ZUN spells it in such a way. --Masuo64 13:52, 29 August 2009 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Well my position will always be that whatever ZUN names it is what it will be named. If ZUN wants to call it "Marisa's Ultra Sexy Danmaku-Fest" then that will be its official English title regardless of what the Japanese title is. That doesn't mean editors here can't include as a side-note or alternate or literal rendition, the meaning of the Japanese, but that except for that tiny note, the designated English title should reign in all other respects. Similarly, if there is no English title, then there simply is none, and only a small side-comment detailing what the Japanese title means in English should exist. If that is the current situation then the aforementioned procedure is what I will advocate. <a href="../User_TheTrueBlue.html" title="User:TheTrueBlue">TheTrueBlue</a> 14:39, 29 August 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

So if one could, at the beginning of work, save the page once with "Translation Currently in Progress, Date, Username" somewhere near the top, other translators would know to leave well enough alone.

<p>Mainly if there isn't some way to reach a compromise on at least the scripts being posted.

I was thinking perhaps just the text in a section that can't be easily stumbled upon.
</p><p>Before one states "It's ZUN's wish", I do believe that was more in regards to posting videos of it (something I can agree with), not so much keeping it locked up.

<dl><dd>What the fanbase does, pirating or whatnot, is irrelevant to how this Wiki works. As a Wiki, normally we would post spoilers, except that ZUN's policy supposedly says otherwise.</dd>
<dd>Now, ZUN's terms of use, to my knowledge, is broken into two sections - use in derivative work/doujin, and use of snapshots on a webpage. However, I find his own terms of use ambiguous. The first section covers terms for derivative work, which a Wiki is not. [EDIT: "For the usual activities in doujin (uploading material on a homepage" might account for wikis.] The second section covers screenshots, but makes no mention of script. Unless I'm missing something, there seems to be no explicit rule against posting ending scripts for the sake of a Wiki. I can only propose two possible remedies - either email ZUN for clarification ("just ask me and I'll respond"), or follow the example of the Japanese wiki. - <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">Kiefmaster99</a> 00:47, July 17, 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>If anyone doesn't know about it, colonel_aki's Life of Maid is a 4koma series that centers the daily lives of the SDM residence. The 4koma series is very enjoyable and its highly amusing. colonel_aki combines a cute art style with very witty humor and it does not require any understanding of the Japanese language since there's no actual spoken dialogue but the characters acts out the scenes very well and the readers can get the idea of the jokes in the comics. The series also uses some of the fannon stuff in the Touhou series, like Yuyuko being a glutton and Patchouli being an otaku.

<p>I'm confused on the standard of linking back to the main page. Most of the important pages seem to have a link back at the top and bottom. Should all pages have this? Also, is it necessary when one can click their back button, or simply click on the Alice icon to get back to the main page? <a href="../User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 19:52, August 23, 2010 (UTC)

<p>Sure I'm somewhat "new" here, but anyways, here's a task that I believe we could do. Adding these templates (such as Navbox templates) to each and every page that should have them. For instance, Soku's pages don't have the Soku Navbox template on all pages yet, compared to say SWR and earlier games.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Spell_Card_compilation">Spell Card compilation</span></h2>
<p>Would it be okay if I compiled all known Spell Cards (arranged by character) into one big list?

This may or may not involve putting a link to spell cards either the Main page or each character page, and linking to the game-specific spell card pages.

<dd>If Wikia decides to remove the old skin for good/fail to address my problems with the new skin, then I am more inclined to support a split. On the other end however, this would have to be a complete move - the old site would have to be removed and become a redirect. Otherwise we'd end up with a divergence of contributors, and a predicament similar to having two SWR wikis.</dd>
<dd>If I remember correctly, the move to Wikia was initially made to get the wiki off of the Poosh server, possibly due to bandwidth issues (I don't remember).

<dl><dd>Hmm, I'm now looking at this arguments on first time. I don't object to tbe suggstion positively. But the issue in my heart the most is... Pooshlmer, I think you would be the best contributor in the sense that it seems you've been involved in this wiki the longest of all editors of this site. Do you think it's OK to move Touhou Wiki in another address? I feel like we should confirm the administrator's OK before search for new address, and you've never say yes.

<dl><dd>So far, he has given implicit approval (asking for what type of hosting and whether they're prepared to pay $100/mo).</dd>
<dd>Another question - (when) should we put on the front page that we are currently in the process of moving? Perhaps we should send a message to all contributors just so that they are aware of this. As well, after what date can we expect to not see edits made to this wiki be carried over to the next? - <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">Kiefmaster99</a> 04:10, November 7, 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

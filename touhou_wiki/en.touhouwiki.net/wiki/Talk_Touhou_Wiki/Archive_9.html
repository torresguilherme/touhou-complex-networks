<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Very_long_News_section">Very long News section</span></h2>
<p>Lately, the News section has been gradually getting bigger and bigger. Now it's pretty ridiculous. The problem though is that it pushes the other important index links (Encyclopedia, Other Articles, Articles Needing Attention) further down the page hurting front page functionality. Something needs to be done to shorten the News section on the front page.
Some possible solutions have been suggested.
</p>
<dl><dd>1. Keep a short list on the front page, "Show more" goes to a different page with all the links.</dd>
<dd>2. Expandable "Show/Hide" on front page.</dd>
<dd>3. Trim non-important items completely.</dd></dl>
<p>Options 1 and 2 will keep all news items but will require additional coding to be done to support it. Option 3 requires none, but will affect the quality of the news section. How should be contract the News section? <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> 03:48, 23 December 2011 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Theories_Section">Theories Section</span></h2>
<p>(I posted this here cause it won't just be aimed at the characters pages). Anyway, due to Sakuya's page, as well as Maribel's page, I thought we should create a "Theories" section on some pages, and as to my taste, it doesn't really fit well under the Fandom section with large paragraphs bulleted. As for examples, I've made an edit on the <a href="../Touhou_Wiki_Guidelines/Standardization_of_Character_Pages.html" title="Touhou Wiki:Guidelines/Standardization of Character Pages">standardization page</a> to show the layout as well as setting it out on my <a href="../User_Tony64/Sandbox" title="User:Tony64/Sandbox">sandbox</a> on how it would look on the pages. As for a main summary, <a href="../../indexbad1-3.php?title=User:Tony64/Template:Theories_Summary&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Tony64/Template:Theories Summary (page does not exist)">this</a> will be used, similar to <a href="../Template_Bougetsushou" title="Template:Bougetsushou">Template:Bougetsushou</a>. Would it be OK to implement this? <span lang="ja">～</span> <a href="../User_Tony64.html" title="User:Tony64">Tony64</a> <sup>(<a href="../User_talk_Tony64.html" title="User talk:Tony64">Talk</a>/<a href="../Special_Contributions/Tony64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tony64">Con.</a>)</sup> 19:25, 3 January 2012 (UTC)
</p><p>Also, I still need to write some sort of guideline to this to stop users from adding unwanted theories. <span lang="ja">～</span> <a href="../User_Tony64.html" title="User:Tony64">Tony64</a> <sup>(<a href="../User_talk_Tony64.html" title="User talk:Tony64">Talk</a>/<a href="../Special_Contributions/Tony64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tony64">Con.</a>)</sup> 19:31, 3 January 2012 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Perhaps the guideline is that the theories should have a degree of significance <b>in relation to the character</b>. Right now, I actually cannot think of any character that would actually have any theories of great significance except for Sakuya, Maribel, and (only maybe) Alice. Any others should be heavily scrutinized. In other words, I think that the best guideline is that for now, this section can be okay only for Sakuya, Maribel, and Alice's pages unless a very good reason comes up for some other character.--<a href="../User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">Tosiaki</a> 19:52, 3 January 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Maybe theories sections should only be allowed for characters where ZUN specifically indicated there's an actual secret of significance to be found. Mainly Sakuya (Where ZUN has explicitly stated she DOES have a background, etc. He just isn't telling anyone what it is, and has stated that whole "Eirin is surprised" and "more can be uncovered in Cage in Lunatic Runagate" (or whatever he said in that interview where he said it)) and Maribel (Where ZUN has explicitly responded to a question about her relationship with Yukari, but left it at it having something to do with Lafcadio Hearn). I'm not sure Alice qualifies because ZUN never explicitly stated there's a secret to be found there. The whole "Alice's background contradicts!" runs under assumptions that just because she was found in Makai, Shinki created her, when ZUN never really stated as such. It also runs under the assumption that the PC-98's finer details should be considered in the Windows series, which again (IMHO at least) is something we really can't assume, given several other possible contradictions (Marisa learning Star Magic after meeting Reimu when the trial version of her boss battle with Reimu in the PC-98 series explicitly states it's their first meeting, and Kurumi being a vampire when Remilia's stated to be the only known vampire to currently exist.  Both leave open room for interpretation, as Marisa doesn't state it's their first time meeting in the full official version of the game, nor does Perfect Memento say there were any other vampires in Gensokyo before the only known CURRENT vampire).  ....well, it is admittingly a big enough deal with the fandom that maybe it could be included regardless.</dd>
<dd>...unless you're referring about a theories section for Alice for Dolls in Pseudo Paradise, I guess. But my huge wall of text theory for that has been shrunken down enough to fit where it currently is without needing a section of its own (although if you want to re-add/revamp all that stuff I wrote about it back to it and make it its own section, that's fine with me).  Oh, and I guess maybe one for Remilia regarding the Vampire Incident (although IMHO the fact that EVERY non-SDM character with the exception of "I treat everyone the same" Reimu refers to Remilia exclusively as "The Vampire" should make it a reasonably safe assumption that Remilia is "The Vampire" from "The Vampire" incident). I guess whether or not the Lunarians like Lord Tsukoyumi is the same as the original shinto god might qualify too, if only due to that one being a particularly bizarre case. ~ <a href="../User_TiamatRoar.html" title="User:TiamatRoar">TiamatRoar</a> 20:17, 3 January 2012 (UTC)
<dl><dd>*headdesk*  And maybe Yukari.  ....okay, yea, this is harder than I thought. ~ <a href="../User_TiamatRoar.html" title="User:TiamatRoar">TiamatRoar</a> 20:27, 3 January 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Well, perhaps to talk about the theories regarding Alice's background could perhaps go in between the "trivia" and the "fandom" sections, if there is ever a need to list things out (since it won't grow to the size of Sakuya's "theories"). As is, perhaps the theories section should therefore be only limited to Sakuya and Maribel - nobody else should have one. It is simply a matter that the two are exceptional, which is why the theories need their own section - for the other characters, it can go elsewhere.--<a href="../User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">Tosiaki</a> 20:36, 3 January 2012 (UTC)

</p><p>Like Tosiaki said, it should really be as a subsection under Fandom, but I think that should be the case for everyone. However, pages are already long enough and I'd rather not lengthen them even more with a bunch of needless cruft. Furthermore, there's no reason the underused Contemplations section couldn't be used for such things, including in the case of Sakuya. I say we should write a sentence or two to a paragraph about these theories, and link to a separate page under Contemplations. Characters like Sakuya or Maribel with a whole host of lengthy theories can have their own page, while we have another page for miscellaneous character theories for everyone else. <a href="../User_UTW.html" title="User:UTW">UTW</a> 14:16, 4 January 2012 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>For the case of Sakuya and Maribel, though, the theories are very much directly related to the character as ZUN himself has made comments about them, which is why they need to be on the page - not true for any other character. Sakuya and Maribel do not have a "whole host of theories" - they have exactly the theories that are right now on their pages. Of course, even with those theories, there would be a problem with going too much into speculation on the character pages itself, so for the case of Maribel, I have included everything I thought was important to say under "Is there a relation to Yukari?" section - and left everything else under fandom. I think that this amount is the amount that should be included.--<a href="../User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">Tosiaki</a> 19:32, 4 January 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>(This isn't going just as ZUNNED... DX). Anyway, the original plan was to keeping it to what ZUN has officially leaked about certain theories that are very well known (which I mean that even ZUN would certainly know), but to just start with keeping to Sakuya and Maribel having this section (Was hoping it to have gone to other non-character pages, but meh). Also, like I said, it doesn't fit well under the Fandom sectio-n, as well as the Additional Information section, since all of it is bulleted and can make the layout look weird compared to other character pages. That's why I suggested it have it's own h2 section. Anyway, I'll start implementing Sakuya's to see if people do agree. <span lang="ja">～</span> <a href="../User_Tony64.html" title="User:Tony64">Tony64</a> <sup>(<a href="../User_talk_Tony64.html" title="User talk:Tony64">Talk</a>/<a href="../Special_Contributions/Tony64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tony64">Con.</a>)</sup> 21:40, 4 January 2012 (UTC)
</p><p>On the other hand, though, I do think that it would be a good idea to have a sub-section to talk about the six main theories on how Yuyuko might have killed herself (seppuku ritual suicide, stabbing her chest, cutting her throat, drowning, poison, and hanging herself), but it will not go under a "theories" section. I will get to it eventually.--<a href="../User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">Tosiaki</a> 09:55, 5 January 2012 (UTC)
</p><p>The reason why I would say that those suicide theories should be included on the character page rather than contemplations is because there is actually substantial official evidence for all six.--<a href="../User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">Tosiaki</a> 10:02, 5 January 2012 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>You have official evidence for all six mutually exclusive theories of suicide? Unless they are all true and Yuyuko is Rasputin, you're being terribly inconsistent. If six different users presented six different theories and each of them believes he is right and the others are wrong, edit wars are inevitable regardless of how much official evidence they have to back up their claims. That's why moving these theories (and not just about Yuyuko, but about any character) to the <a href="../Contemplations.html" title="Contemplations">Contemplations</a> page is a reasonable compromise.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>And if you do decide to talk about exactly how Yuyuko died (and to my knowledge the answer appears to be "I don't know"), please mention at least some of these theories are just theories. (And put it under a "Theories" section, pretty please?)</dd>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>No, these are not just "theories." As Yuyuko is a bourei it is important to talk about them. They are not "six different users" - these are actually the six with substantial official backing, and it is important to talk about <b>what official sources say about her suicide</b> and this would be important to include them, but only official sources.

<dd>But in any case, when I earlier stated that only Sakuya and Maribel should have "theories" sections, I completely forgot about Yuyuko's important theories related to her father, the cherry blossoms of the Sumizome, and her suicide method.

<dl><dd>I've heard about these six suicides (poison, seppuku, stabbing her chest, as mentioned in my user page), and some of them seem to have some backing, but I never knew there would be official backing for all six methods! I dunno if you mean that ZUN explicitly said "yeah, all six methods are true" or that Yuyuko's method of death is described differently among different official sources (like <a href="../Silent_Sinner_in_Blue.html" title="Silent Sinner in Blue">SSiB</a>, <a href="../Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense.html" title="Perfect Memento in Strict Sense">PMiSS</a>, or ZUN's blog, etc.). If it's the latter case then I guess it won't be a problem to include them (yes it might sound inconsistent but there are indeed some inconsistencies within the world of Touhou Project, such as Mystia being eaten by Yuyuko but appearing again in the next game, so we can give it the benefit of the doubt).</dd>
<dd>Yes indeed we need to include a section about Yuyuko's death as she is a ghost and a part of Yuyuko that some of her fans are unaware of. I was always wondering why it's only described briefly in the fandom section and not appearing in some of the contemplations page.

<dd>Also, although we are not Wikipedia, I think that when it comes to dealing with things like this, we should generally follow what Wikipedia does with censorship, because we are essentially documenting information.

<dl><dd>Right now, the most risque pictures we have are, to the best of my knowledge, some of (not-so) Innocent Key's album covers. For album covers, we follow Wikipedia's censorship policy.

<p>That is what I was suggesting.
You are correct, many NSFW pages are redundant and the only way for users to come across these is prior knowledge. 
</p><p>A separate option besides Kief's solution to having NSFW warning next to the link is having a redirect including the pages, then it will link to the Section that contains Hentai, (yes, there should redirect to a general page instead of each having their own NSFW redirect page as that gets redundant again.)
I'm not so sure with the acceptance of this option so I'll need others opinions on how to carry such a thing out (if at all)

<dd>I am against it, for a few reasons.</dd>
<dd><s>One, this wiki must serve the interests of the English fanbase. I fail to see how there is a language bias, since this wiki is English.</s></dd>
<dd>Two, first consider that almost all works are denoted as X ~ Y. I am against solely adopting X as that would lead to mass confusion for works of where X is shared upon multiple works (Touhou Sangetsussei). Y acts to differentiate, and thus far, no two works share Y. <s>The only glaring inconsistencies in this naming scheme are <i>Touhou Hisoutensoku</i> (because "Chase the Enigma..." is too long and no one likes using it) and <i>Fairy Wars</i> (because "Fairy Wars" is used in the game itself).</s> While ZUN most likely reversed the typical order for his games for this reason (DS, FW), he doesn't for his print works (EaLND, SaBND, OSP; SSiB, CiLR, IotMaIotE). If anything, X ~ Y would have to be used.</dd>
<dd>To adopt this scheme for only games and not print works leaves a glaring inconsistency across the wiki.</dd>
<dd>As for file names, for the reasons mentioned above, using only X isn't going to get you very far. <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> 05:33, 14 February 2012 (UTC)

<dd>This is just for the filenames for files used in offshoot games only.  As files go, everything is shared across all of the wikis, so it is kind've an issue with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Internationalization and localization">i18n</a>.

<dd>Well indeed if the current ones are left as they are (such as Ctc and MB), then that would be a case of inconsistency across the wiki, and may become a source of confusion for newbie editors (e.g. another spin-off comes out, a new editor mass-uploads the images of spell cards, and it turns out the editor used the naming scheme for previous games before this was implemented - because the editor referred to the previous naming schemes). So if the new naming scheme has to be implemented, it might be best if we implement it across all spinoff games, including previous ones, and, as Momiji pointed out, it has some degree of possibility of screw-ups, so it must be carried out systematically. --<b>This message from <a href="../User_Deathsoul4.html?title=User:Deathsoul4&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Deathsoul4 (page does not exist)">DeltaSierra4</a> was delivered on</b> 06:03, 14 February 2012 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>With respect to Kief's point of duplication, consider the Danmakufu games Phantasm Romance―幻想浪漫紀行― and 幻想浪漫紀行 -Phantasmagoria Trues-, which clearly have the same Japanese part (one is a remake of the other).

<dl><dd>I'm in favor of your suggestion, Kyo, if we can change the last step into "combining initials of Japanese-English". In this case, "Touhou Kaikeidou ~ Marine Benefit" would come out as THKKDMB. If that's too complicated we could take other steps like "use only the first three letters of the English name" or "Use numbers along with Japanese initials to differentiate between different games." Come to think of it, I don't think we used numbers in differentiating between different games with similar initials. --<b>This message from <a href="../User_Deathsoul4.html?title=User:Deathsoul4&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Deathsoul4 (page does not exist)">DeltaSierra4</a> was delivered on</b> 21:12, 14 February 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>

<dd>This is for the meaning though. The game title will still remain <i>Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil</i> in French and English, but for each language, the meaning will be "Eastern Lands of the Scarlet Devil ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil" or "Pays de le demon ecarlate de l'est ~ L'incarnation du demon ecarlate".</dd>
<dd>As for whether Touhou is separate, I'd like input from other Japanese fans on how they treat 東方. My impression is that ZUN began to use 東方 for a song title in its original meaning, and then decided to use the song title as a template. If that is true, "Eastern" is the best translation.

<dd>Wow, I should've responded to this discussion a long time ago...</dd>
<dd>I'm probably not going into too much details as most stuff I wanted to say (such as the issue about Touhou being separate and what not) has already been brought up and it's probably redundant to say it, but I don't see much problem with the current translation (i.e. "Eastern ~" instead of "Touhou ~"). If we're looking for a good word choice in translating, it's best to go for a word that best conveys the meaning and feeling of the original text, right? In a technical sense, the word itself of "Touhou(東方)" isn't the true meaning of "Touhou" (yeah, it does sound awkward when somebody asks me what "りんご(Ringo)" is in English and I've to answer "りんご" means "Ringo" instead of "Apple). Even though Touhou is now indeed much like a brand name, or like a proper noun, there is still associated meanings to each brand name/proper nouns (such as how "Chloe" would mean "young green shoot" in Greek, its original language). --<b>This message from <a href="../User_Deathsoul4.html?title=User:Deathsoul4&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Deathsoul4 (page does not exist)">DeltaSierra4</a> was delivered on</b> 07:49, 29 February 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

<p>I've been thinking about this again, and maybe we could allow for change of spelling based on how ZUN uses it. This would be an additional rule unique to this wiki, and that is "if ZUN uses a spelling variant for a particular word, we should follow it." This means <i>colour</i> gets shifted to <i>color</i> (because ZUN has employed <i>Colorful Path</i>) and that instances of <i>judgement</i> should be kept as that (due to <i>the Last Judgement</i>, relevant to Shikieiki's theme).

For one thing, a great deal of canon literature for things related to Sakuya is devoted to things that are uncertain, but that does not mean that they are not canon facts themselves.

<dd>The canon information used in speculation should already be mentioned elsewhere if it's notable.

Nothing under "Her Father" references canon except for the two game quotes which are only vaguely related to anything. The "Ink-black Cherry Blossom" mention in her spell cards might be worth one line in Additional Information, if even that, since most characters have allusions to thematically-related myths and legends in their spell card names.

The five paragraphs on Yuyuko's page talking about the original poetry are not necessary, they're just repeating the same points to "support the theory" that it's based on an existing myth, which isn't even a theory, it's obvious and already stated on the appropriate profile page.

<dl><dd>In actuality, the "Her Father" section is more related to Yuyuko, whereas the "The Ink-Black Cherry Blossom" is, as you say, more related to the Saigyou Ayakashi. In that case, all that shows is that "The Ink-Black Cherry-Blossom" could simply be moved to the Saigyou Ayakashi page, not that it should be removed altogether.--<a href="../User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">Tosiaki</a> 03:10, 19 March 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>However, since all of the current theories sections are not really speculation, perhaps they should be re-named into other things so as to cause less confusion.
</p>
<ul><li>Sakuya: rename to "Mysteries" - it is a canon fact that Sakuya is mysterious, and several things related to that have been examined in canon.</li>
<li>Tewi: rename to "White Rabbit of Inaba" - it is a collection of canon facts relating her to the White Rabbit of Inaba</li>
<li>Maribel: <i>move the contents of the theories section to the fanon section</i> - it is pretty much actually an explanation of something in fanon.</li>
<li>Kasen: remove the "theories" as a section, keep the sub-sections as is - it is a collection of canon facts related to two separate things</li>
<li>Flandre: rename to "Concerning her lock-up" - it is a collection of canon facts related to whether she is locked up or not.</li>
<li>Yuyuko: same as Kasen - they are actually all collections of canon facts.</li></ul>
<p>While it is true that there is no need for speculative "theories" sections, none of the current sections are really speculative, so they should all be renamed to things other than "theories."
</p>
<dl><dd>The suggestion above is quite disputable, especially for Sakuya's page: You know that renaming the whole section would hurt the consistency with other articles? --<b>This message from <a href="../User_Deathsoul4.html?title=User:Deathsoul4&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Deathsoul4 (page does not exist)">DeltaSierra4</a> was delivered on</b> 01:11, 19 March 2012 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I actually find the concept of the "standardization of character pages" somewhat questionable. Of course, we do not need to follow Wikipedia in everything we do, but when they take the approach of not setting rules for naming every section the same way for every character, it seems much more sensible that way.--<a href="../User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">Tosiaki</a> 01:13, 19 March 2012 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, when the changes would be made to the names of the sections that are mentioned above, there would be no sections named "Theories" so I am not sure how that would hurt consistency with other articles, even if that was desired in the first place.--<a href="../User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">Tosiaki</a> 01:28, 19 March 2012 (UTC)
<dl><dd>So you're not changing just those 6 articles but all other character articles as well? I find "theories" to be a better word choice compared to "mysteries". If you feel like using "mysteries", why don't you use it in the section to denote these theories then? --<b>This message from <a href="../User_Deathsoul4.html?title=User:Deathsoul4&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Deathsoul4 (page does not exist)">DeltaSierra4</a> was delivered on</b> 01:54, 19 March 2012 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It is because, as IbarakiIbuki stated, "theories" necessarily involves speculation, so there seems to be no reason to call it "theories" if there is no speculation.</dd>
<dd>Also, it should be noted that my above list is actually exhaustive - there are no other character pages currently with a "theories" section.--<a href="../User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">Tosiaki</a> 02:00, 19 March 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I think it's time to ask the definition of official sources in your standards. Do you intend to include nicovideo as such an official source? In my standards it's limited to only texts published by Team Shanghai Alice, ZUN, or some collaborative work he participated in. --<b>This message from <a href="../User_Deathsoul4.html?title=User:Deathsoul4&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Deathsoul4 (page does not exist)">DeltaSierra4</a> was delivered on</b> 01:07, 19 March 2012 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Nicovideo Encyclopedia is not an official source, just like how this website is not an official source - it is a secondary source that can be an indication of what is important in canon, just like this website, the only difference being that there are many more people working over on the Japanese side and have much more experience with this than we do. There are many canon things, and other than the list of works in the <a href="../Touhou_Project.html" title="Touhou Project">Touhou Project</a> page, there is also this miscellaneous list of official literature <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.toho-motoneta.net/index.php?%A5%EA%A5%F3%A5%AF%BD%B8">here</a> (of course, excluding the <span lang="ja">ファンサイト（東方元ネタ関連）</span> section of that page, since those would be secondary sources).--<a href="../User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">Tosiaki</a> 01:11, 19 March 2012 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In essence, Nicovideo Encyclopedia should be thought of as playing the same role as this Touhou Wiki, except that they have much more expperience and have much more people working on it.--<a href="../User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">Tosiaki</a> 01:43, 19 March 2012 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I appreciate that comparison, except the second part shows some extraordinary haughtiness.  Touhou Wiki was founded early 2006, and some of the editors here were Wikipedia editors before then.  <a href="../User_Momiji.html" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Momiji">Momiji</a> 02:04, 19 March 2012 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I am not saying that we don't have knowledge and experience ourselves - it is just that when it comes to the size of the fanbase, and their greater knowledge of how it would be related to Japanese culture (notice how a great number of articles on the English Wikipedia about Japanese culture are of poor quality), it is only natural that they would have worked on it more than we have... if it was a mistake to say that, please do say so - I only thought it natural to say that, but if this is haughty, I do apologize, and will not say so again.--<a href="../User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">Tosiaki</a> 02:16, 19 March 2012 (UTC)</dd>

<dl><dd>I don't think there is any character page that is citing them. If you are talking about my reference to it in talk pages, it should be noted that I have only talked about it in the context of talking about what Japanese people find important within Touhou canon. I also do not quite know why you say, "go work with them and not us."--<a href="../User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">Tosiaki</a> 01:55, 19 March 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><s>Sorry if I have commented too much - in the course of all this, I have done my best to put forward my views in a logical manner, without trying to simply talk more for the sake of talking, but rather because I believed I had substantial facts.

<dd>Just for clarification, when you say "this bickering," are you referring to personalized discussions?

I also found that your condescending tone isn't accidental, you've on record done this at least 9 other times to other members here including me.</dd>

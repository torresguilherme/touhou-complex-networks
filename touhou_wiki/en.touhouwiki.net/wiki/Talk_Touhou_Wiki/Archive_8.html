<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Character_Page_Sections">Character Page Sections</span></h2>
<p>I'm using the <a href="../Reimu.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Reimu">Reimu</a> page as a baseline along with the new InfoBox layout.
</p><p>Right now, the sections are divided like this;
</p>
<dl><dd>Main Description</dd>
<dd>(Contents Box here)</dd>
<dd>1 Concept
<dl><dd>1.1 Name</dd>
<dd>1.2 Appearance</dd>
<dd>1.3 Occupation</dd>
<dd>1.4 Relationships</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>2 Story</dd>
<dd>3 Additional Info
<dl><dd>3.1 Trivia</dd>
<dd>3.2 Fandom</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>4 Spell Cards</dd>
<dd>5 Official Profiles</dd>
<dd>6 Official Sources</dd></dl>
<p>Currently, I'm thinking of chopping out section 1.3 and merging it with the Main Description. I think that the first few paragraphs of the page should describe the character briefly, its personality and the character's status quo(Ex. Reimu is a shrine maiden who solves incidents). I find that very hard to do without repeating myself in the occupations section. The InfoBox also has a occupations section.
</p><p>Also, I don't think that 1.4 fits well in "Concept". Relationships are not part of the character's concept; the name is, the appearance is, but not the relationships. Should we put this section somewhere else?
</p><p>Many other pages are like this and currently the model for the InfoBox layout is like this. Should we change/standardize it?
</p><p><a href="../User_Sefam.html" title="User:Sefam">Sefam</a> 04:10, 9 August 2011 (UTC)
</p><p>I feel that 1.4 would allow to see how the relationships evolve over time if it's under story.
<a href="../User_Nazeo.html" title="User:Nazeo">♥★♦</a> 16:04, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Note that "concept" is all optional. If some information is too short and fits better in the intro that is good, I guess. And other optional subheadings are fine too, like for the ability. And subsubheadings could be used too (Refering to <a href="../Yukari_Yakumo.html" title="Yukari Yakumo">Yukari Yakumo</a>). ~ <a href="../User_Quwanti.html" title="User:Quwanti">Quwanti</a> <sup>(<a href="../User_talk_Quwanti.html" title="User talk:Quwanti">Talk</a>)</sup> 16:08, 24 August 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Right, I understand that.
For example, not all characters have a special occupation(<a href="../Rin" class="mw-redirect" title="Rin">Rin</a>) or notable ability that has to be explained (<a href="../Yuugi.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Yuugi">Yuugi</a>) 
It was more along the lines that the information, if they did have that stuff, should be presented the same way in the same places if they are there.
</p><p>This is what I'm thinking...
</p><p>(These borrow elements from Sefam and UTW and one other person I'm forgetting. Sorry.)
</p>
<dl><dd>Main Description</dd></dl>
<p>A short Summary of Character on top of Contents box
</p>
<dl><dd>(Contents Box here)</dd>
<dd>1 Concept
<dl><dd>1.1 Name</dd>
<dd>1.2 Appearance</dd>
<dd>1.3 (Personality)</dd>
<dd>1.4 (Some other thing) *Optional</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>2 Story (with links to their dialogue)</dd>
<dd>2.1 BackStory  *Maybe Optional... (Reason being I'm not sure if all characters do have a backstory)
<dl><dd>2.2 Relationships</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>3 Additional Info
<dl><dd>3.1 Trivia</dd>
<dd>3.2 Fandom</dd>
<dd>3.3 (Some other thing that doesn't fit under these two) *Optional</dd>
<dd>(Other notable thing goes here) *Optional</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>4 Spell Cards</dd>
<dd>5 Official Profiles</dd>
<dd>6 Official Source</dd></dl>
<p>(The top is subject to change)
</p><p>What I find missing often is a summary on top of the profile, dialogue, appearance is missing, things like that.
So, tell me what you think!
<a href="../User_Nazeo.html" title="User:Nazeo">♥★♦</a> 16:41, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Yes, something like that, plus a maybe reference (youtube for example). But I think relationships should be part of "concept". ~ <a href="../User_Quwanti.html" title="User:Quwanti">Quwanti</a> <sup>(<a href="../User_talk_Quwanti.html" title="User talk:Quwanti">Talk</a>)</sup> 19:10, 24 August 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Sorry, too many pages to keep track of and I thought things were finally settled on. One, I suggested the optional Personality under Concept, in case that ever needs more elaboration than what's touched on in the opening summary. 
</p><p>Two, I don't believe Relationships makes much sense under "Concept", which along with what Nazeo said, implies to me that it should be used mostly for the bare bones of a character. I wonder if this is too rigid a thought. Obviously the other option is to forget this very literal definition, cram it all under Concept again and leave Story for that alone, especially since Story is so lengthy for some characters. 
</p><p>Also, thinking about the way I laid out some articles like <a href="../Mononobe_no_Futo.html" title="Mononobe no Futo">Mononobe no Futo</a> or <a href="../Toyosatomimi_no_Miko.html" title="Toyosatomimi no Miko">Toyosatomimi no Miko</a> when adding the historical/fictional/mythological basis, I realized Name and these descriptions usually go hand in hand in most articles, so I thought Name should be renamed Name and Basis or something (when Basis information is available, anyway).<a href="../User_UTW.html" title="User:UTW">UTW</a> 04:13, 28 August 2011 (UTC)
</p><p>Don't be sorry, I'm just making sure that the work on these don't conflict later.
(Also, while I agree with what you said about the relationships. it was <a href="../User_Sefam.html" title="User:Sefam">User:Sefam</a> who stated that, not me, lol)
I looked at your work and I agree with the set-up, (though I added Relationships as a later thing)
For Basis, it translates back as concept, so I think that'll work for now unless it's like <a href="../Rin" class="mw-redirect" title="Rin">Rin</a> who's occupation may have a reference to Buddhism and makes the character (which would be optional because other characters may or may not have have notable qualities like that in regards to Concept)
</p><p>Sorry <a href="../User_Quwanti.html" title="User:Quwanti">Quwanti</a>, but IMO, relationships make more sense to me in the story section.
Your reference ideas if they have a basis in history can be a subsection under Trivia but on top of Fandom.
</p><p>What worries me is the position of the Backstory section.
If it's on top, 1.it can possibly spoil the story, but if it's under it, 2. it may repeat what the story already stated (though a simple fix may correct that 3. is that it shouldn't be a sub and be italicized and crammed somehere)
So far, I'm with # 2, anyone else has their own spin on this?

<h2><span id="Heaven_within_the_Youkai_mountain?"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Heaven_within_the_Youkai_mountain.3F">Heaven within the Youkai mountain?</span></h2>
<p>I believe there should be a location category called "Worlds Above" (天空) in the "outside Gensokyou" section. The "underworld" has its own category, so I suppose there should be a category for everything above gensokyo as well. The netherworld/hakugyukuro/heaven could be moved to this section (I'm not sure if the netherworld required its own category...The Hakugyokuro could even be a subcategory within the "netherworld" page). I would also add in the senkai (仙界) there, which is where the bosses of th13 moved over to after leaving the mausoleum beneath Myouren temple. Maybe even the "Dragon Palace" (竜宮) in the thunderstorm clouds as well...though i'm not sure if there's enough facts for it to have a page of its own.  
</p><p>Heaven and the Youkai mountain isn't literally connected by a road. It's more like a summit where the open passage through the clouds above are visible.
Right now according to the wiki, it looks as if the Yama sends you to the youkai mountain once you reach ascension... <a href="../User_Tren" title="User:Tren">Tren</a> 03:07, 19 August 2011 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Stubs">Stubs</span></h2>
<p>Now the "stub" template isn't very clear. Yes, the page isn't fully finished and defenitly needs revision, but I think the "stub" template could be expanded for a bit. So having different kinds of stubs, "Translation stubs", "Character stubs", "Game stubs" etc. My idea is that when you do something like 
</p>
<pre>{{Stub|Game|(list of stuff that needs to be done)}}
</pre>
<p>The first "Game" will be categorized as "[[Category:Game stubs]]
</p><p>And the template will show a very small box with small text, and using the &lt;toggledisplay&gt; to show and hide the small list of tasks. And in the middle "This article about a game is a stub. If you can add to it in any way, please do so."
</p><p>Sure, it could be put on the community portal, but it is useless to put every stub there.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Game_Navbox_restructuring">Game Navbox restructuring</span></h2>
<p>I've been considering the (official) game navboxes, and I think we can organize them far better than they are right now.
</p><p>My biggest concern at the moment is that we have a page/subpage structure named "translation". This is, in my opinion, a rather useless structure. The translation page itself is hardly even useful, and the most I've seen it do is link to the scenario pages. Nothing the navbox can't do, in any case. As for its use as a header, I'm pretty sure everyone who comes here expects to see a translation anyway, regardless of whether the header labels it explicitly or not. I think we can safely do away with it.
</p><p>And so, in its place, I thought it would be far better to unify the groups under the headers "story", "gameplay" and "documentation" for most games. Prologue/extra story, scenario/extra scripts, characters and locations all belong under the Story subsection. Strategy and spellcards belong under Gameplay, and Documentation is for anything else within the game files, like the music comments and afterword. Not all games navboxes will look the same, of course, but I mean as a general guideline. Games like Shoot the Bullet that lack a story as such would retain the Translation structure for instance.

<p>Yes, yes yes yes yes yes yes.  Please, and thank you.  I've hated "Translation" ever since we started the subpage setup and the navboxes as they are.

<dl><dd>Can someone tell me why the redirects created are marked for deletion?

<p>To Quwanti: Ok, I'll keep that in mind (I'll also do EoSD). I'll use the edits you did as a reference. The formats for these in the story are more of summaries of what they contain. Like Reimu's Translation page would be a summary of what she did and the Afterword would also be a summary of what it contained. (The summaries are there for the ones that just want the jist of it without clicking on the link, but for the ones who do want that, it's there.)
</p><p>If you could show me an example by editing any of the 4 I did anything I made to (<a href="../EoSD.html" class="mw-redirect" title="EoSD">EoSD</a>, <a href="../IaMP.html" class="mw-redirect" title="IaMP">IaMP</a>, <a href="../IN.html" class="mw-redirect" title="IN">IN</a> ,<a href="../PoFV.html" class="mw-redirect" title="PoFV">PoFV</a>) for the game pages and the translation pages (Because I like the format for all of it like the ZUN comments before the actual was told and the like, except you are right with the Afterword as I have no idea what to do with it...) that'd be cool of you.

<p>Saw this term. What makes speculation official? When ZUN goes "Hmm yes that may be the case I guess though I never explicitly wrote that"? --<a href="../User_Tsukihime.html" title="User:Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a> 05:44, 4 October 2011 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Dunno that it was even used. Given that the term "official" is related to ZUN, if ZUN says something about his work then it's fact, not a speculation.

<p>I like the blue myself.
Reason being as <a href="../User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> said, it does indeed match the theme better.
If we made skins in the far future, then this would be a great idea to have different colored orbs, but that is a different matter entirely...
As for the shade, I'm indifferent to it.

<h2><span id="Colors/Colours"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Colors.2FColours">Colors/Colours</span></h2>
<p>I am a little confused about some stuff. A while ago, Nazeo did some spellcheck edits and part of that was changing "Colour" to "color" (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../indexf447-2.php?title=Undefined_Fantastic_Object/Gameplay&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=228676">http://en.touhouwiki.net/index.php?title=Undefined_Fantastic_Object/Gameplay&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=228676</a>). Now the edits aren't bad or something, but something came to my mind.
</p><p>Two of Marisa's themes, "Love-Coloured Magic" and "Love-colored Master Spark". Both has "love-colo(u)red" in it's name, but why does both have different spellings? ☢ <a href="../User_Quwanti.html" title="User:Quwanti">Quwanti</a> 21:20, 9 November 2011 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I would assume neither themes had english titles and consequently an american and someone-not-american (british, canadian, ... ) translated it as such, and therefore now you have two versions of "colored". --<a href="../User_Tsukihime.html" title="User:Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a> 06:39, 10 November 2011 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well, that sounds logical. One thing I want to say with this is that such spelling "errors" doesn't need to be changed, otherwise those two themes should get changed too. ☢ <a href="../User_Quwanti.html" title="User:Quwanti">Quwanti</a> 22:41, 10 November 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It's a minor detail. I'm sure anyone would associate "color" and "colour" with the same concept.

<p>Erm, the only reason why I did that is for consistency sake.
(I checked with Keif on the matter, see <a href="../User_talk_Nazeo.html#User_page" title="User talk:Nazeo">my talk page</a>)
From what I understand, this Wiki adopts the American English standard, but again, I don't really care which one we use.
If we start using the British English Ver, I'll gladly change them back.
As for the songs, I await what the community decides on it before acting.

</p><p>It kind of seems like we're making an issue out of something that's not really an issue...... As Momiji said earlier, unless a game/article/music/etc. was titled that way, either en-us or en-uk would work. If we were to change all "colour" into "color", then that means all "dialogue" will have to return to "dialog" and so on.

<p>I'd prefer not to make an issue out of this. However, history has shown (at least on Wikipedia) that this has a potential to create edit wars. This is why I prefer to default to the Wikipedia standard.
Based on how I'm interpreting what Momiji has said, I may or may not support it. If Momiji was supporting <i>one English variety across the wiki</i>, then I am against it as it will only annoy everybody else who doesn't use that spelling. If Momiji was supporting <i>one variety for spelling <b>Love-colo(u)red Magic</b></i>, then I would support it only for sake of translation consistency.
In that case then, we use Love-coloured Magic, since that is the earliest spelling used in this wiki (see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../../indexc3b7-2.php?title=Imperishable_Night/Music&amp;oldid=40751">here</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../../index21bf.php?title=Story_of_Eastern_Wonderland/Music&amp;oldid=55932">here</a>). <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> 01:45, 14 November 2011 (UTC)

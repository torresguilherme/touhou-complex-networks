<p><b>Attention all Touhou Wiki editors</b>: Touhou Wiki will be in read-only mode on 2012-08-08, this Wednesday, for server migration. Migration is scheduled to start at approximately 18:00 PDT, at which point the wiki will go read-only. Users will be unable to make edits until the migration is complete, but the wiki will remain available for users to read in the meantime.
When we finally switch the servers over, some users may still wind up at the old locked wiki.

<p>This is something that extends to the Western Touhou Fandom (abbreviated henceforth as WTF) as a whole, not just something I've seen on the wiki. It concerns the use of "<b>arrange</b>" when discussing fanmade Touhou music. My issue is less with the fact that this is grammatically incorrect, but that it's grammatically incorrect AND such a widespread problem. I propose we fix this by starting to use the correct word, "<b>arrangement</b>", and editing older articles about doujin circles to reflect this, and attempt to curb any new articles from using this old, incorrect term by incorporating this as some sort of guideline. <a href="../User_OverCoat" title="User:OverCoat">OverCoat</a> (<a href="../User_talk_OverCoat" title="User talk:OverCoat">talk</a>) 06:34, 21 August 2012 (EDT)
</p>
<dl><dd>I can see where you're coming from. To provide some explanation, "arrangement" <i>is</i> the musically correct term to use. "Arrange" comes from a translation of "<span lang="ja">アレンジ</span>" (arenji), which is what the Japanese use to refer to musical arrangements. Of course, the Japanese love to abbreviate terms. In this case, <span lang="ja">アレンジ</span> is actually an abbreviation of "arrangement". However, people initially translated it directly as "arrange", and that translation stuck. As mentioned earlier, from a musical point of view, the term "arrangement" is the correct term to use. As such, I support the use of "arrangement" over "arrange" and would encourage others to do the same. <b>I Agree.</b> <a href="../User_K.html" title="User:K">K</a> (<a href="../User_talk_K.html" title="User talk:K">talk</a>) 08:16, 21 August 2012 (EDT)
<dl><dd>The proper word to use is arrangement (n). Arrange is a verb, and its use as a noun is not supported by English dictionaries. I support renaming to arrangements. <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User talk:Kiefmaster99">talk</a>) 08:32, 21 August 2012 (EDT)</dd>
<dd>Thanks for the explanation on the origins of "arrange." I went ahead and used <a href="../Doujin_music.html" title="Doujin music">Fan Music</a> as a sort of "test" because I'm a jerk, and people will be able to see exactly the kinds of changes I'm talking about. I'll wait for a bit more consensus before prodding to change more, last I saw there were article titles and also lists that use the word "arranges" as a noun.<a href="../User_OverCoat" title="User:OverCoat">OverCoat</a> (<a href="../User_talk_OverCoat" title="User talk:OverCoat">talk</a>) 13:39, 22 August 2012 (EDT)
<dl><dd>Lol, I thought you were using that term on purpose. If proper English is needed on the wiki, I'll support the renaming too.--<a href="../User_Doncot.html" title="User:Doncot">Doncot</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Doncot.html" title="User talk:Doncot">talk</a>) 09:12, 21 August 2012 (EDT)</dd>
<dd>I don't know how often "arrange" is used as shorthand for "arrangement" in the fandom, but I do support using "arrangement" on the wiki because it makes sense from a musical and a grammatical point of view. <a href="../User_IbarakiIbuki.html" title="User:IbarakiIbuki">Ibaraki Ibuki</a> (<a href="../User_talk_IbarakiIbuki.html" title="User talk:IbarakiIbuki">talk</a>) 19:56, 22 August 2012 (EDT)
<dl><dd>Actually, I don't think K's theory of <i>arenji</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">アレンジ</span>)</span> being an aberration of "arrangement" is true (at least this's the first time I've heard such a story). Not just "arrange" but taking in foreign word in their verb forms and turning them into nouns and start treating them like nouns is very common, because in Japanese, the majority of loan words can only be used via compound words that takes the "(noun)+<i>suru</i>" form (e.g. スタートする [start], プレイする[play], インストールする[install]). By goggling, you can see that フラワーアレンジメント ("flower arrangement") is more popular/relevant than フラワーアレンジ ("flower arrange"), which shows that this isn't a case of abbreviation-ness , but due to usage in grammatical terms in each language (meaning that unlike "arrange", the term "flower arrangement" was taken from English directly as a whole phrase). Which even reinforces more of the irrelevancy of the "arrange" in English.--<a href="../User_Doncot.html" title="User:Doncot">Doncot</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Doncot.html" title="User talk:Doncot">talk</a>) 04:03, 23 August 2012 (EDT)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I wonder if I'm the only one that opposes this?  We've never corrected the grammar of words in titles that are already in English (or "Engrish" for that matter).  For example, "Demystify Feast (Arrange)" should be along the lines of "A Demystifying Feast (Arrangement)", however the word "Arrange" already exists in the title in romanized letters.  There is a similar argument for "the Last Judgement".  I oppose this change for instances that the word "Arrange" already exists, and therefore I <b>oppose</b> any changes from "Arrange" or "Arranges" to "Arrangement" or "Arrangements" for the sake of consistency. <a href="../User_Code_Slasher.html" title="User:Code Slasher">Code Slasher</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Code_Slasher.html" title="User talk:Code Slasher">talk</a>) 17:42, 25 August 2012 (EDT)
</p>
<dl><dd>I should clarify this further. In the music world, titles of music and albums are never <i>formally</i> translated, out of respect for the original composers. For example, Wagners "Der Ring des Nibelungen" is the actual title, even if it does translate to "The Ring of the Nibelung." If a Japanese composer calls his song "Demystify Feast (Arrange)" then we have to accept that title whether we like it or not. The usage of "arrange" I'm talking about refers to its use outside titles, where it is most definitely incorrect. This is not going to be a global correction, the only changes will be to the names of the category/template parameters, and encouraging users to use the grammatically correct "arrangement" in any future edits or additions to the wiki. I hope that clears things up for you.<a href="../User_OverCoat" title="User:OverCoat">OverCoat</a> (<a href="../User_talk_OverCoat" title="User talk:OverCoat">talk</a>) 07:15, 26 August 2012 (EDT)
<dl><dd><dl><dd><i>In the music world, titles of music and albums are never </i>formally<i> translated</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Really? Because we call <i>Der Ring des Nibelungen</i> as "<i><span lang="ja"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ja:ニーベルングの指環" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ja:ニーベルングの指環">ニーベルングの指輪</a></span></i>" in Japanese. And I'm pretty sure that most titles in non-Latin alphabet are translated when referred in English (e.g. «<span lang="ru"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ru:Щелкунчик" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ru:Щелкунчик">Щелкунчик</a></span>» -&gt; <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nutcracker" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Nutcracker">The Nutcracker</a></i>).
<dl><dd><i>If a Japanese composer calls his song "Demystify Feast (Arrange)" then we have to accept that title whether we like it or not</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Actually, you <i>can</i> alternate the title if you don't like it in the translation, you can even call it the <i>Semi-boss Theme (Arranged)</i> or <i>Th9.5 Track 2-20</i> if you wish. What you <b>CAN'T</b> do is that you can't change the music titles written in the "original title" section; other then that it really doesn't matter, because <i>technically</i> speaking, every other　fanmade alternative titles except the original is not officially correct (we call Beethoven's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._5_(Beethoven)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)">Symphony No. 5</a>, <i>Fate</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ja:交響曲第5番_(ベートーヴェン)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ja:交響曲第5番 (ベートーヴェン)">運命</a></span>)</span> in Japanese if you haven't known). And the only reason we're not changing the title in the translations if they're in English, is because that's the obvious consensus everybody have reached even without discussing on this wiki (= the English Touhou community). Therefore I believe it is recommended that every editor should start using "arrangement(s)" instead of "arrange(s) [noun]" though out the wiki, and I believe Code Slasher's opposition isn't really an issue, because like I said irrelevant English used in the original title are exceptional to begin with.--<a href="../User_Doncot.html" title="User:Doncot">Doncot</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Doncot.html" title="User talk:Doncot">talk</a>) 10:55, 26 August 2012 (EDT)
<dl><dd>I would be worried that Touhou Wiki users viewing the song titles with "Arrange" in them might change them to "Arrangement" if they see "Arrangement" everywhere else on this wiki.  Consistency is a major factor for any wiki wishing to appear professional, but maybe I'm worrying too much? <a href="../User_Code_Slasher.html" title="User:Code Slasher">Code Slasher</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Code_Slasher.html" title="User talk:Code Slasher">talk</a>) 02:01, 29 August 2012 (EDT)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

And today we got some adorable images from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://leomodesto.tumblr.com/">Leo</a> of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://askudonge.tumblr.com/">Ask Udonge</a> fame.  <a href="../Touhou_Wiki_Frontpage_modifications.html" title="Touhou Wiki:Frontpage modifications">Check the modifications</a> and let us know what you think.  <a href="../User_Momiji.html" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Momiji">Momiji</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Momiji" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:Momiji">talk</a>) 04:02, 28 August 2012 (EDT)

<dl><dd>I <b>approve</b> of this change to the main page. Finally, some personality! <a href="../User_OverCoat" title="User:OverCoat">OverCoat</a> (<a href="../User_talk_OverCoat" title="User talk:OverCoat">talk</a>) 04:10, 28 August 2012 (EDT)
<dl><dd>I like it too. Pretty neat, very <i>American</i> if I should say. Going a bit off topic but also related, can't we replace the logo of Alice in the left right comer and Reimu icon in the "donate menu" as well? I thought they haven't cleared copyright issues. --<a href="../User_Doncot.html" title="User:Doncot">Doncot</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Doncot.html" title="User talk:Doncot">talk</a>) 04:53, 28 August 2012 (EDT)
<dl><dd>That is the plan, although we'll figure that out later when everyone is awake again.  <a href="../User_Momiji.html" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Momiji">Momiji</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Momiji" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:Momiji">talk</a>) 04:58, 28 August 2012 (EDT)
<dl><dd>While the Three Fairies seem to fit at their spot, no matter what, I still think any tengu would fit better for a news section. Though, since it is a fairy-styled frontpage, Aya or Hatate seems so random then. ☢ <a href="../User_Quwanti.html" title="User:Quwanti">Quwanti</a> 10:58, 28 August 2012 (EDT)
<dl><dd>I somewhat like the fairies, but I think there will definitely be stronger opposition elsewhere. Brace yourself for criticism if it test rolls out.</dd>
<dd>The main criticisms I can think of is that they detract from the rest of the main page from style contrast. Color-intense pictures are being placed over lighter coloured headings, and there seems to be a conflict in mood as well. <s>That, and the Daiyousei/Cirno image seems out of place - putting them above/behind the page requires the rest of the page to be bumped down</s> (plus, this change was made for some reason), which is unnatural, unless that blank space is utilized for something else.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the new colour scheme, the red and yellow headers should be darker. <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User talk:Kiefmaster99">talk</a>) 12:44, 28 August 2012 (EDT)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>But... what if I like the donate and main logos?  There's only one thing I can say about the changes, though...

<dl><dd>The existing logo and donate images are nice, but I want something that's actually ours to use.  <a href="../User_Momiji.html" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Momiji">Momiji</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Momiji" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:Momiji">talk</a>) 03:12, 29 August 2012 (EDT)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>I rather disapprove of this. It really makes the page look a lot less professional looking.  I mean its cute but I'm against it.  <a href="../../index8514.php?title=User:Zelinko&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Zelinko (page does not exist)">Zelinko</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Zelinko" title="User talk:Zelinko">talk</a>) 20:39, 29 August 2012 (EDT)
<dl><dd>The fairies add a bit of pizazz to the front page, but I can see where Zelinko is coming from.  Perhaps we should take out Lily White, Cirno, and Daiyousei? <a href="../User_Code_Slasher.html" title="User:Code Slasher">Code Slasher</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Code_Slasher.html" title="User talk:Code Slasher">talk</a>) 21:53, 29 August 2012 (EDT)
<dl><dd>Is "professional-ness" really a matter here? Because we're not actually "professionals", and don't need to be like the plain and bland wikipedians making the wiki look like a "true encyclopedia". Regardless, the design itself should need to be considered fully though. For instance, in some environment (like iPhone), the fairies are hiding the text a little, and I think this should be fixed.--<a href="../User_Doncot.html" title="User:Doncot">Doncot</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Doncot.html" title="User talk:Doncot">talk</a>) 08:33, 30 August 2012 (EDT)
<dl><dd>It does to some extent, and perhaps "professionalism" isn't quite the best word to describe it. Touhou Wiki is not much of a forum - it's more of a library (think Patchouli). As a wiki, we do want to keep our image as a site focused on information first - so some academic is actually preferred, however bland or sterile it may seem. If we go over the extreme end of overusing images, we start losing credibility, much like what happened to you know where.</dd>
<dd>But, coming from the other side, I can see where they are coming from. Compared to other wikis, we have one of the most bland designs, with no real distinguishing feature that makes this a "Touhou" wiki. If we look at the front page (previously), the only features that make this "Touhou", are the game icons; and the Alice and the Reimu donate buttons, which are on the sidebar. The colour scheme vaguely connects to Alice. The other feature we have is the yin-yang icon. The yin-yang icon is an good example of adding "Touhou-ness" without being too overbearing. It's related, and clean and simple.</dd>
<dd>Let's compare what other fan wikis, such as Super Mario Wiki, Bulbapedia, and the Puella Magi Wiki, do. SMW has a more colourful front page, roundycorners, and two light backgrounds (one w/ text, another with mushrooms), which are in theme with the franchise itself. Bulbapedia has a theme that revolves around Pokemon 001, the wide use of the "bulb" logo, and use of roundycorners and circles. PWW doesn't have much other than its header background.</dd>
<dd>Touhou Wiki as of now doesn't have much of a 'personality'. We still have a LOT of design space and room - background, colour scheme, symbols, etc. The red-yellow-blue colour scheme is a nice touch, to match with our three primary categories, and Touhou has at least one trio that fits (other than the fairies, we also have Reimu, Marisa, Sakuya/Sanae). Expanded use of yin-yang is a possibility.</dd>
<dd>Others have mentioned that Cirno, Daiyousei, and Lily are a bit problematic, likely because Lily is too unrelated (when Aya would make more sense), and Cirno and Daiyousei for kind of just being there and gimmicky. <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User talk:Kiefmaster99">talk</a>) 11:24, 30 August 2012 (EDT)
<dl><dd>As said in this section's title, the theme is Fairy Wars. Thus taking out <i>only</i> Lily and adding Aya would make the other ones (Suny, Luna, Star) become unrelated at the same time (technically Aya did appear in FW but...).--<a href="../User_Doncot.html" title="User:Doncot">Doncot</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Doncot.html" title="User talk:Doncot">talk</a>) 11:49, 30 August 2012 (EDT)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I rolled out some fixes with Momiji yesterday to accommodate smartphone users and people with small resolutions(1024 wide), the fix also applies when you minimize and squish the screen, so that the fairies do not hide the text anymore. Part of the reason why fairies are on the frontpage rather than Reimu/Marisa/Aya/Company is because we want to use them in the sidebar/header. If Reimu is in the header, she appears on every page of the wiki, while the fairies only appear on one page. Also, another reason, albeit weak, is that the 3 fairies of light fit the color theme, and I can come full circle with all the fairy characters in Touhou (Maid fairy, zombie fairy etc... can't really be considered characters, because they are generic enemies), I don't want people complaining because I put Sakuya for the blue color (That was the original idea, Reimu is red, Marisa is yellow, and Sakuya is blue) instead of Sanae or the opposite. --<a href="../User_Sefam.html" title="User:Sefam">Sefam</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Sefam" title="User talk:Sefam">talk</a>) 12:21, 30 August 2012 (EDT)
</p><p>I like it. I don't see the problem with Lily. She's trumpeting the news, like she would spring's arrival. I have no real issue with how it reflects on us, either. More leeway can be given to fanwikis and it shows some personality rather than coming across as another serious, stuffy wiki. Although Kiefmaster has a point about how we could look at how to use other page elements.<br>
But there's no reason why this little changes our concern of being an information first wiki. As always, what matters are articles and showing our professionalism through those, as long as we don't start detracting away from articles with images on those pages, too.<br>
As for other little changes, a minor one would be to maybe change the colors of the game/music/book infoboxes to match the Three Fairies' colors. although I'm not sure everyone would go for that.<br>
Also, to match themes, might we get Leo to do the new logo, as well? If that isn't already happening or you have something else in mind, I mean. Plus, Alice is great and all, but it might be an opportunity to replace her with Aya or something. Or rotating logos, so a new Alice, Aya, Marisa, etc. might all show up and get their share, but that might be asking too much. <a href="../User_UTW.html" title="User:UTW">UTW</a> 01:12, 3 September 2012 (EDT)
</p><p>Well, overall reception to the changes seem to be warm for the most part, with few minor complaints, so good work. I am willing to back the game/music/book infobox colour change, but would like to get a feel of how they would look first. 
As for logos, I would prefer sticking with Alice, and non-rotating, only because she was there first. Each other language wiki has their own logo which helps give their identity, and English is no different. Why Alice was chosen is beyond me, but I can only guess it was because she was the most English/Western-like character and an appropriate fanpic existed. <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User talk:Kiefmaster99">talk</a>) 21:14, 3 September 2012 (EDT)

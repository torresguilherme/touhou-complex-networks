<p>I'm posting that "more minimal" one not as an actual proposal but as something that lets us talk about one change at a time instead of all at once.  Losing the purple doesn't hurt at all.  Just slamming the TOC to the top, however, makes the wiki look very abrupt.  Wowpedia gets away with a very small title just above a TOC that I think would work well.  We could add that in then put a news bar on the right where Music is right now.  I have to agree I don't see the point of that much TOC for music.  Just one link stuffed somewhere that goes to Music's own section would be sufficient.  To be clear, I'm not suggesting our TOC should look anything like Wowpedia's, I'm just talking about the half sized title there and the news bar on right.  Thoughts?  -- <a href="../User_Tubercular_Ox" title="User:Tubercular Ox">Tubercular Ox</a> 12:18, 18 December 2010 (PST)
</p>
<dl><dd>IMO, the blue goes so much better with the Vector theme, at least, but I don't use the other themes, so I can't quite speak for those on Monobook or whatnot.Â ;) And I must say, Wowpedia seems to know what they're doing. It's a very nice theme in general. And I agree that we definitely need to compress <i>something</i> if we want to put some kind of News section in, which I personally favor highly. It's also a lot more easy to not have to scroll very far. <a href="../User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 13:13, 18 December 2010 (PST)
<dl><dd>Personally I was going to try to make the blue the same color as Alice's dress on the top left, but all I got is MS Paint and I'm drawing a blank on how to figure out what color that is so I just lifted your blue. -- <a href="../User_Tubercular_Ox" title="User:Tubercular Ox">Tubercular Ox</a> 16:36, 18 December 2010 (PST)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Oh! Here's an idea I guess I'll throw out there. Are the Japanese titles for the games really necessary for the front page? If you look at the left column, it is extremely wide compared to its contents. If we were to get rid of the Japanese on the front page and compress the column widths, there would be quite a bit of room left. Tell me if I'm jumping the gun too much by giving more ideas, lol &gt;_&lt; <a href="../User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 13:15, 18 December 2010 (PST)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Like I said before, I think that the games shouldn't be listed in the front page at all, which would help make it look a lot less cluttered. <a href="../User_Master_Bigode.html" title="User:Master Bigode">Master Bigode</a> 14:10, 18 December 2010 (PST)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Where would you put the games then?  And what would you have instead?  The games links are the ones I use the most when I go to the front page.</dd>
<dd>As for what to do with the TOC, I was toying with some ideas in my head.  If we compress it, it makes it look like nested frames, where we got the alice frame on the left, then a frame inside that one w/ the TOC, and then the "page."  Or at least that's how it'll look.  If we move the narrowed TOC to the right there's a bracket effect (which works, see wowpedia) but that's a big departure from the current layout.  In short, narrow, narrow, wide looks funny, and narrow, wide, narrow means either the TOC is moved or it looks as it does now... with a whole bunch of extra space.  I am sick as a dog right now but if I weren't I would try moving the TOC to where music is now and putting the "news" stuff where the TOC is now.  Also, even though I used the words "news," I don't know that there's enough Touhou news, or that the front page is an appropriate page for that kind of thing.  I was thinking more of the stuff that was in the two paragraphs that I just ripped out -- What touhou is, a welcome message, and the irc channel.  I'm trying to think of this from the POV of someone who is new to touhou and wandered into our wiki looking for info, which is how I found the site.  Wanted strategy advice... which is why I think the games should stay on the front page.  But I'm open to persuasion.  -- <a href="../User_Tubercular_Ox" title="User:Tubercular Ox">Tubercular Ox</a> 16:36, 18 December 2010 (PST)
<dl><dd>Ideally, if we <i>were</i> to eliminate the individual game links from the front page, there would be a page listing them all - something akin to <a href="../Music_CDs.html" title="Music CDs">Music CDs</a> or whatnot. I'm not quite for removing them myself, though. I think they're rather important. (Maybe in a few years, when there are twice as many, we'll need to, but not now.) I also still think a News section would be nice, because it'll alert people to what's going on without them having to go to a forum and get the contents of a new game spoiled or something. I dunno. It would make more sense if we all lived in Japan to have the manga releases there though.Â :/ <a href="../User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 17:34, 18 December 2010 (PST)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

</p><p>Some pages dislike the blue background: <a href="../Imperishable_Night__Music" class="mw-redirect" title="Imperishable Night: Music">Imperishable Night: Music</a> Or is this just my machine somehow?  The japanese font shows up in white there for me, but not on other pages.  Haven't dug deep to see what the difference is.
</p>
<dl><dd>After browsing a few other pages, I don't like the blue background either. A simple change to white would fix this. Also, where did the bolding for the Japanese text on game pages go? <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">Kiefmaster99</a> 20:24, 17 December 2010 (PST)</dd></dl>
<p>Poking around finds a different problem: <a href="../Moedan_Spell_Card_1" class="mw-redirect" title="Moedan Spell Card 1">Moedan Spell Card 1</a> some people saved their images with an assumption of a white background.  In that page, mixed with the image with a proper alpha channel, it's uneven.  Dunno what else will be affected.  -- <a href="../User_Tubercular_Ox" title="User:Tubercular Ox">Tubercular Ox</a> 19:54, 17 December 2010 (PST)
</p><p>The main page is needlessly unorganized and far too busy, now. What was the point of making things less efficient and organized compared to the previous layout that's been used for many years, since it was hosted on pooshlmer.com? Was it all just to slap some tiny little box art thumbnails on it? To quote someone else's reaction, "Guilty of the same crime as Wikia. This is perfectly functional, let's change it!" I find the new layout to be sloppy, unorganized, and to be blunt, a clusterfuck. It looks far less professional and functional than the previous longstanding design, and now requires additional navigation to anything that is not one of the games. I'm sure I'll get a lot of flak for voicing my opinion, but it is just that, an opinion. I far prefer the old main page. Functionality and efficiency over useless and distracting fluff.--<a href="../../index3472.php?title=User:Betty&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Betty (page does not exist)">Betty</a> 20:20, 17 December 2010 (PST)
</p>
<dl><dd>I think the first criticism to get out of the way there is "Perfectly functional, let's change it."  I have to admit I didn't really question why you were changing the front page.  What was the goal?  If you feel it's not perfectly functional, what's missing? -- <a href="../User_Tubercular_Ox" title="User:Tubercular Ox">Tubercular Ox</a> 20:40, 17 December 2010 (PST)</dd></dl>
<p>After browsing a few other pages, I don't like the blue background either. A simple change to white would fix this. Also, where did the bolding for the Japanese text on game pages go? With regards to Betty's comments, I think some points are valid. Also, we need the feedback so that if we screw up in a way that doesn't seem obvious to us, we'll know. There are some points that ought to be addressed regarding the layout by other users:
</p><p>Emphasis on Games section
</p>
<dl><dd>Chronological or categorical</dd>
<dd>Thumbnails of covers</dd></dl>
<p>Contraction of other section
</p>
<dl><dd>Official literary works</dd>
<dd>Official music</dd></dl>
<p>Other misc categories
</p>
<dl><dd>Possible to remove some of them</dd></dl>
<p>New section: News
</p><p>While I do think that games are important, I also think that easy access of ZUN's works are also important. If there's too much clustering of some of them, maybe we could clump some into a group (i.e. æ±æ¹ä¸æç²¾, æ±æ¹åææ, Akyu's Untouched Scores), but then that would come at a cost to those unable to recognize the titles (e.g. IotMaIotE). We could also afford to remove some of the more underused links (such as, dunno, Strategy or Locations) and sort them into other categories. We would have to gauge use of each link to determine whether it should be removed or not. <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">Kiefmaster99</a> 21:10, 17 December 2010 (PST)
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The main page may have been "functional", sure, but there were quite a few reasons I saw a need for a change. First off, it's ugly. Purple? Seriously? Secondly, it's organized poorly. Naturally, don't you think a front page should present the most general topics available on the Wiki? I admit, I did put *all* of the games on there, but that is only because I felt it was justified, being the main focus of the entire franchise, and all. The idea was to present a front page in a more compact and organized way, so we don't have to scroll down to find everything like we do now - the header paragraphs themselves take up <i>half the page</i>. My intent wasn't to make it really flashy, but the front page as it is now is on the opposite extreme.</dd>
<dd>Also, I can't understand how someone can think the new version was unorganized? It was simplified and organized further, honestly. If you can't think of a way to explain what you're talking about, then I have no real reason to pay attention to you.</dd>
<dd>For example, listing Akyu's Untouched Scores and the five ZUN CDs on the front page, and then just having some "other" link on the bottom was dumb - if you're going to list them, what about the CDs included with the artbooks, and the ones with the manga tankobon?</dd>
<dd>Also, the presence of a "miscellaneous" section is complete blasphemy. This is a Wiki. If it can't be categorized better than that, then it might not deserve to be on the front page.</dd>
<dd>Of course, I don't really know how many times these links get clicked. Some of the things may need to stay on the front page anyway, but without some kind of usage statistics, this isn't really possible for me to know &gt;_&gt;</dd>
<dd>In addition, I spent quite a bit of time recategorizing a lot of pages. Go check it out at <a href="../Category_Content.html" title="Category:Content">Category:Content</a>, it's quite different, and what I used to base the front page on.</dd>
<dd>In regards to the new theme: yeah, we didn't test it anywhere near as thoroughly as we should have, so that's out of the question at this point. <a href="../User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 21:59, 17 December 2010 (PST)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I really think we should have a main page revamp; it is best to have a fresh start, and to improve search engine results. We don't want the wikia wiki to be at the top, and search engines rank too similar sites lower, preferring the older site. That said, it would be better if the main page revamp didn't have cover images for each of the games. <a href="../User_Mugendai.html" title="User:Mugendai">Mugendai</a> 22:36, 17 December 2010 (PST)
</p>
<dl><dd>I'm still chewing over everything everyone's said, but a question about search results:  If we vandalize the wikia home page will that help?  It'll be different from ours here. -- <a href="../User_Tubercular_Ox" title="User:Tubercular Ox">Tubercular Ox</a> 06:19, 18 December 2010 (PST)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Regarding search engine results: As of now, our website is 4th from the top on Yahoo and Bing (after ThWikiOld, Wikipedia entry, ThWikiOld:Characters). Now Google for some reason likes to rank two other pages (SWR, Alice Margatroid) higher than our main page.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Oh boy, here we go. Checking out the two links near the top, it's come to my attention that the 'new' main page wasn't even presenting properly(And still refuses to when I check the history). It displays as <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/690/newlayouts.jpg">[1]</a> this abomination. The properly loading and whatnot page version does fix several of the problems I complained of, it still sufers from several problems. At least, you know, in my opinion. The first problem I see is that I want to throttle whoever came up with the hideous Cirno color scheme. Why would you go so far out of your way to align the wiki, which should be about canon, with some horrifying and awful fandom trait?  On top of that, if I'm right, it apparently went through for the entire wiki being that color? I'd just as soon switch back to going to Wikia if the whole thing was Cirno so baka lol xD (9) blue.
<br>I'm still heavily against having thumbnails because it just seems a bit silly. The original page, that we've been using since 2006, is a very concise list of every important section on the wiki right there on the front with all the important canon works right there. To be honest, this whole 'changing the main page' thing seems to be a kneejerk reaction to Wikia. This wiki was around before Wikia, and changing it just because of a small stint of being hosted on wikia seems dumb and pretty childish. 'Google ranking' is not honestly that big a deal, and it will change in time. I also don't understand this talk of having to scroll way down on the old front page. You barely have to scroll at all. I'll take scrolling over having to click anywhere between two and five times more links to get to where I'm going.
<br>As a last thing to say, I can't even begin to understand why the new version was taken down after barely any criticism, or why all this talk was started over what appears to be a single contention based on a bug. Maybe everyone is talking about it somewhere else, but I barely see any negative comments aside from my own on this talk page. Relax, take it easy. <br>Why can't I seem to avoid making giant walls of text? Stupid wiki talk pages, why must you make multiple paragraphs look like multiple people?<br>--<a href="../../index3472.php?title=User:Betty&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Betty (page does not exist)">Betty</a> 03:24, 18 December 2010 (PST)
</p>
<dl><dd>You can manually add &lt;br&gt; tags to get smaller line breaks if you're the top level commenter.  If you're responding to someone else's comment, you can preface each paragraph with the right number of colons.</dd>
<dd>Yeah, it's a little annoying.  I usually just accept being a block of text.</dd>
<dd>I hope you don't mind, I altered yours as a demonstration, and overparagraphed mine as a second demonstration -- <a href="../User_Tubercular_Ox" title="User:Tubercular Ox">Tubercular Ox</a> 06:49, 18 December 2010 (PST)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Yeah, the new main page wasn't coming up correctly because we were using styles from the redesign, but the one linked at the top of this page should be okay, so just look at that one instead. I'm actally not aware whether or not <i>that</i> version appeared on the front page yesterday. I believe the ugly borderless one was up yesterday, which is why it was taken down so quickly. We can't quite take it easy, either: this is, after all, the new front page we're talking about. We need to move forward carefully, and if the styles weren't working for the front page last night, it's only natural we take it down.</dd>
<dd>The color scheme: yeah, it was my idea, but if you look at the talk page, I state multiple times that I had no idea what I was doing with the colors. No one seemed to want to help me out there. It wasn't a specifically Cirno color scheme, but I understand how it came off that way. In terms of a <i>good</i> color scheme, it would probably be better off matching the rest of the skin; I just didn't want that ugly purple anymore.</dd>
<dd>You'll have to be more specific about thumbnails being "silly". There is no reason not to have them on a front page. My problem with the front page now is not that it's the same as it was on Wikia - that's a ridiculous assumption, thoguh I did think we needed something to symbolize a "new start", or something - it's that it's an ugly list that basically just throws up all the most-clicked-on pages for people to click on, along with ugly purple. I'm afraid I'm going to have to stand by linking to broader categorical pages than specific ones on the basis that this is, after all, a Wiki project.</dd>
<dd>With regards to the current front page's scrolling: I'm on a 1440x900 monitor. It's quite likely you have a larger resolution(at least vertically), so you may not have to scroll as much, but I can only see links to Touhou 1 through 3 there.Â :( <a href="../User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 06:58, 18 December 2010 (PST)
<dl><dd>lol.  I'm on 1024x768.

<p>To address some points I made and Darkslime brought up:
Forgetting that other official music did exist (Fanbook/Manga arranges and Fighting game OSTs), you bring up a point. Also, I overlooked that the "Catch-all" categories were removed, which I suppose was a good idea. Two other questions then.
ZUN's other games, Seihou and Uwabami Breakers, are sorted under Unofficial works. Seihou is not Unofficial, but at the same time, not strictly Touhou either. Those works would probably need a page of their own.
"Catch-all" categories have to exist in one way or another for some rather more obscure/underused things. Ideally, I should be able to access any article that exists in the wiki from the front page (because what good is it when an article exists but can only be accessed via Search). In particular, I am referring to the links removed from your revision. Upon closer inspection, the only ones that I see that need attention are English Patches, Config, and Game Tools and Modifications. Two of them could be merged into one. English Patches could be resorted under Games or something, or just deleted and replaced with a Category.
Anyways, I'm just dumping every possible criticism I can think of, partly for sake of argument, and also to iron out any potential oversights.
</p><p>With regards to rolling out the new test page, a few things:
Don't put "The new page is ready" when it isn't. I thought one borderless rendition looked hideous. Use "Please wait warmly" or some other variant. Also, keep it up for at least 24h to get feedback. Otherwise the only responses you'll be getting are from those with Touhou Wiki on their watchlist.
Is it possible to poll other users with regards to front page design? <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">Kiefmaster99</a> 04:17, 18 December 2010 (PST)

<dl><dd>to respond to this... the redesign concept was first brought up by <a href="../User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> and also <a href="../User_TTEchidna" title="User:TTEchidna">TTEchidna</a>. since then, there have been a number of concepts but most people seem to forgot that the idea was out there. after deployment, the initial reactions were so overwhelmingly negative that the authors of the revision, <a href="../User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> and <a href="../User_Momiji.html" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Momiji">Momiji</a>, decided to revert them until further revisions. in this aspect, I believe we are exactly the opposite of how Wikia conducted themselves. =) this experiment does seem to have resurrected discussion on the topic, which is a good thing. <a href="../User_Chloe" title="User:Chloe">Chloe</a> 13:01, 18 December 2010 (PST)
<dl><dd>Actually, I was the one who was first throwing around the idea of a front page revamp(even before we decided to move), lol. <a href="../User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 13:10, 18 December 2010 (PST)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>I have trouble seeing Seihou and Uwabami Breakers as "ZUN's games", in particular; they are both unofficial in the sense that neither were created by <a href="../Team_Shanghai_Alice.html" title="Team Shanghai Alice">Team Shanghai Alice</a>. I understand what you're saying, though.</dd>
<dd>No, the point of a Wiki is not to be able to access any article from the front page. And besides, I was in the process of linking individual English Patch pages and Game Tools pages from each of the official games, but I suppose I should have gotten farther with that. I'm not sure why Config should be front-page material, though.</dd>
<dd>The new page was ready, but we didn't know that the underlying styles weren't going to work; that's why it appeared so hideous. :D Please refer to the link at the top from now on. That's why we took it down so soon, though. We may try to put up the <i>actual</i> one soon.</dd>
<dd>I dunno if polling is possible, but I think this brings up a really good point about the difficulty of community changes here: there's no way to get even a fair amount of people to weigh in on this thing. <a href="../User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 06:58, 18 December 2010 (PST)
<dl><dd>Polls are possible; there was one on the Nethack wikia regarding the move. Also, don't the individual game pages already link to the English patch? -- <a href="../User_Qazmlpok.html" title="User:Qazmlpok">Qazmlpok</a> 07:35, 18 December 2010 (PST)

<p>Okay, there is that faggy message about joining this discussion everywhere so I will do so and state that current design is very OK (also that minimalistic is not bad either) and those alternatives are scaring the shit out of me! So changing nothing would be wonderful (simplifying it won't harm it that hard either). --<a href="../User_Touhoufag" title="User:Touhoufag">Touhoufag</a> 16:57, 18 December 2010 (PST)
</p>
<dl><dd>It is not a "faggy" message - despite this being the Internet, that's just offensive. The point of the message is to get peoples' opinions on important things that are going on at the moment. (It would help if you could elaborate a bit more, as well, but that may be too much to ask from everyone) <a href="../User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 17:30, 18 December 2010 (PST)</dd>
<dd>Personally if I thought it'd make everyone happy and improve the wiki I'd wear a rainbow leotard and sing about my love for Rinnosuke in countertenor.  Darkslime's right though, some more detail on what exactly scares you would be helpful. -- <a href="../User_Tubercular_Ox" title="User:Tubercular Ox">Tubercular Ox</a> 20:13, 18 December 2010 (PST)
<dl><dd>Someones sure like to search for offence even if there was none to begin with. Well, to each it's own. And about design...I don't really bother to envelope my criterions with the words (not like I really have those criterions actually lol), but if you ask me, having clear, understandable, without surplus pics is not bad at all. After having been transferred here, THwiki's new (now present) design pleased me a bit (well, that text hat may be indeed unnecessary) by it's simplicity. If you insist, Darkslime's design is like having a bit to much weirdly arranged pics with unnecessary innovative way to arrange game series and having nice void there. Other than that it's not so bad. And for TTEchina...ugh, placing all topics\links of the most importance (imo, ofc) in the bottom is eff, also, weird little text\click area with weird little pics for the game series I can't even discern quickly is also cool. Well, and for current design, windows\frames (so to say) arrangement is a bit interesting, I guess and that "Related Games" one sure is neat. And for me being scared is about Wowwiki. And btw, and original colors of the headers are better that those in "MoreMinimal", those are kinda bright. Is that what you wanted to hear? Well, I don't imagine myself as designer or something, so you are free to ignore it or revile me or something, idc. You asked for opinion, you've got one. Not like I imply that I can do better. Also, about contributing, some other day (month to be precise) that would be probably a fun idea, but not know during the session. Oh and soz for my English.--<a href="../User_Touhoufag" title="User:Touhoufag">Touhoufag</a> 21:39, 18 December 2010 (PST)
<dl><dd>Your English is fine, but there was offense there, whether you meant it or not. That aside, all I was asking was for you to elaborate: so, thanks for that. A front page revamp is obviously going to be fairly different from what we have now, but regardless, your opinion is appreciated. <a href="../User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 11:16, 19 December 2010 (PST)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Well, I have created an account just to say that I like the current front page design a lot, and that I see absolutely no reason to change anything there. - <a href="../../index8c6a.php?title=User:Festin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Festin (page does not exist)">Festin</a> 10:00, 20 December 2010 (PST)
</p>
<dl><dd>Thank you for creating an account on the wiki, Festin. It would help, though, if you gave a couple of reasons your opinion. What strikes you as better about the front page than any of the redesigned versions? That's the kind of opinion the people in charge of doing this really need in order to make a decision like this. <a href="../User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 13:04, 20 December 2010 (PST)
<dl><dd>I'll try to explain as good as I can. There are two things that I like about the current front page: 1)It is minimalistic, calm and easy on eyes, 2)It gives me one-click access to lost of important places without being too large and cluttered. Now, regarding the alternative versions proposed above. The Darkslime version: 1)Small multicolored pictures on blue background feel a bit uncomfortable and redundant - I do not think the pictures make it easier to find a specific game, because a newbie would not know what the CD covers look like, and an experienced player knows the game order anyway, and a simple list is all he needs (I'm generalising from my own example of course, but still). If the pictures are there just for eye candy, then it does not work, at least for me. 2)I use "Music" and "Print works" sections often, and on current front page I can go straight to the album or manga I need. In the new version, I have to go to the "Music CDs" page, and only then to the album page, etc. The TTEchidna version: 1)Text on white is better than on blue, but there is still a dark blue frame. Additionally, there are fields which in my opinion are not really needed on front page, like "Ongoing wiki work". I like the "Official news" field (same for Darkslime version, by the way), butwould not redesign the entire front page for it (maybe we can fit it on the side panel?). I also do not really like the multicolored buttons for games, and the entire thing just feels somehow "squished". 2)Albums and print works are again hidden away. - <a href="../../index8c6a.php?title=User:Festin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Festin (page does not exist)">Festin</a> 01:24, 21 December 2010 (PST)
<dl><dd>Thanks~ The only thing I really take issue out of that is the "ongoing wiki work" field - in my opinion, this would be a great idea to help get people to fill in all the blanks on the wiki. It doesn't take up that much room, in any case. <a href="../User_Darkslime.html" title="User:Darkslime">Darkslime</a> 06:58, 21 December 2010 (PST)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Main_Points_of_Contention">Main Points of Contention</span></h2>
<p>So it seems the first attempt at implementing a frontpage redesign (as well as modifying the styles/theme of the rest of the wiki) didn't go over so well. What went wrong, exactly? Listed below is an organized list that summarizes the major issues people seem to have had with this failed maiden voyage, as well as potential solutions to fix or otherwise sidestep these issues. For those considering giving the redesign a second shot, this might make a more convenient reference than paragraphs of text. Feel free to add on to or otherwise edit this list, because I surely can't think of it all by myself in one sitting! That, and my word isn't law. I could very well get things wrong or miss a few points. -- <a href="../User_K.html" title="User:K">K</a> 23:39, 17 December 2010 (PST)

<ol><li><b>Color Scheme and Visual Design</b>
<ul><li><i>Problem</i>: Using various shades of blue didn't sit too well with certain people, and the blue background also interfered with certain pages. Additionally, I feel that the use of borders everywhere detracted from the simplicity of a typical page, especially in comparison to article pages.</li>
<li><i>Suggestions</i>: Don't stray too far from the design of a typical article page. Keep the background white and use borders sparingly. I wouldn't mind seeing a version of Darkslime's proposed frontpage redesign where the color scheme more closely matched that of the default theme and dark borders didn't appear around nearly every block/cell.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Organization of Content</b>
<ul><li><i>Problem</i>: Some people say that the original design forced the viewer to scroll vertically too much in order to see the list of games and associated works. It is highly likely that many of these same people also applauded the redesign for putting the list of games in a smaller area that consumed less vertical space. But then, some people say that the redesign was way too cluttered.</li>
<li><i>Suggestions</i>: I can't really say right now. What does everyone else think? Where should we cram all of these categories of information (introduction, news, media listings, wiki information)? Should we do away with any of them to simplify the design?</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Use of Images</b>
<ul><li><i>Problem</i>: Apparently some editors are not a fan of images taking up space on the front page.</li>
<li><i>Suggestions</i>: Let the majority decide. Pictures are always nice, but if they clutter up the design too much, perhaps it is just better to do away with them.</li></ul></li></ol>

<p>Hello former wikia members. Editors at the Anti-wikia skin alliance wanted to begin a newsletter to help build a bridge to the former wikias about what is currently happening on Wikia and what is going on at the Anti-wikia skin alliance.
</p>
<dl><dt>45 wikias have left wikia</dt></dl>
<p>As of December 17, 2010, an incredible Forty-five wikias with 7114 editors have signed the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://awa.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Moved_wikis">moved page</a> stating they have left wikia. Other wikias are currently in the process of deciding whether to leave. In response, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://awa.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Retaliation">wikia has desysopped at least 38 administrators and banned 10</a>, usually indefinitely. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://community.wikia.com/index.php?title=Forum:My_meeting_with_Sannse&amp;t=20101218004720">In a meeting with Wikia staff member Sannse</a>  reportedly said "Wikia underestimated the negative response to Oasis..."

<dl><dd>To summarize: We have officially moved off of Wikia, with consensus, to being self-hosted. The move was partially sparked by the new skin change. Our previous host, Wikia, decided to give us a hard time by intervening with the move by 1. Refusing to close the wiki and 2. Refusing to notify visitors that we have moved, and that the old one is defunct. While I would not call this a "war", their actions have stirred resentment among some contributors. <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">Kiefmaster99</a> 18:07, 19 December 2010 (PST)

</p><p>(I know it was posed as a question, but i made it a shouting question! :3 )
</p><p>From what the owner of this wiki told me, she wanted to distance herself as far away from that other wiki and start fresh, which I thought i did nicely here.

<dl><dd>I don't see why we should change the logo just for the sake of changing the logo. I don't know about everyone else, but to me, it's so well established that changing it would be like changing a mascot.

<dd>I also agree with Keiji's point that a change in the logo character is unneccessary. Btw if there is ever an Arabic wiki and Indian wiki who should the characters be? <a href="../User_Deathsoul4.html?title=User:Deathsoul4&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Deathsoul4 (page does not exist)">Deathsoul4</a> 17:56, 31 December 2010 (PST)
<dl><dd>For the record: the English, Chinese, and Russian logos are all decided already (Alice, Meirin, and Nitori, respectively). The German, Polish, Portugese, and Spanish wikis are not very active at the moment so no discussion has been brought up in regards to them, and the French and Japanese wikis are both hosted independently. The discussion is a little moot at this point, but if someone finds a better image than Alice do let me know. =) <a href="../User_Chloe" title="User:Chloe">Chloe</a> 18:11, 31 December 2010 (PST)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

</p><p>Wait a second, this was your idea lol!
</p><p>Didn't you want ideas on the icons?
</p><p>I just act on what people wish me to do, so ummm... change or no changeÂ ?
</p><p>The choices above are up for change, delete and for adding (none of the above is set in stone, you could change Sanae back to Alice for the English wiki and keep Suika for the German wiki), but please add your own list so people can decide how popular each is.
</p><p>I'm really confused right now, so... yeah I'll just roll with it and say make your choice people!

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Signature_time_zone">Signature time zone</span></h2>
<p>Just as I was previewing the above comment, I noticed (again) that the timezone in my signature is forced to PST, regardless of the timezone I have set in my profile. I understand this can't be profile-dependent because it's set when you save the page, but can't this be changed to UTC - or at least say it's -6 instead of using a meaningless acronym? I'm used to every other wiki I'm active at using UTC, so this one is confusing. <a href="../User_Keiji.html" title="User:Keiji">Keiji</a> 10:23, 4 January 2011 (PST)
</p>
<dl><dd>Well it's actually -8 if we go by Pacific Standard Time. Wikipedia also lists Pakistan and Philippine as additional acronyms. But yes, I second your motion to use UTC instead. <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">Kiefmaster99</a> 10:38, 4 January 2011 (PST)
<dl><dd>Whoops, Cirno moment there. I somehow subtracted 10 from 18 and got 6. <a href="../User_Keiji.html" title="User:Keiji">Keiji</a> 10:39, 4 January 2011 (PST)
<dl><dd>This has been changed moving forward. <a href="../User_Chloe" title="User:Chloe">Chloe</a> 00:33, 5 January 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Would it be possible to run some sort of bot to retroactively change all previous comments to UTC? It doesn't have to be done immediately, but would be something to consider for archival purposes. <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">Kiefmaster99</a> 03:07, 5 January 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I do not believe so. As you can see when editing pages, signatures are generated dynamically at the time of using the tag, but become plaintext in future edits. Please correct me if I am wrong, however, and I will implement a solution if one is available. <a href="../User_Chloe" title="User:Chloe">Chloe</a> 03:51, 5 January 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Well, I was thinking of implementing one that will scan all talk pages for 'Time, Date (PST)' and adjust accordingly by adding 8 hours onto time, change date if necessary, and changing (PST) to (UTC). Only thing is, somebody's gonna have to find or write one. <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">Kiefmaster99</a> 09:05, 5 January 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Ah, that's much better. Thanks! Also, such a bot shouldn't be too hard to write, though rather than just adding 8 hours it would be better off using your programming language of choice's builtin functions to convert timezones, to cope with potential DST. <a href="../User_Keiji.html" title="User:Keiji">Keiji</a> 10:14, 5 January 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>So how do I calculate UTC? What's the offset from GMT? Does it even depend on GMT?Â :| --<a href="../User_Tsukihime.html" title="User:Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a> 16:01, 5 January 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I think UTC is pretty much GMT in general use. More specifics on their Wikipedia page. <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">Kiefmaster99</a> 16:07, 5 January 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

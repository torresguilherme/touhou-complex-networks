<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Album_Summaries">Album Summaries</span></h2>
<p>I've been looking through the album pages a lot, finding lyrics and stuff like that, and I've been thinking about the little summaries at the top of the page. I think they could be improved...!<br>
So, the current wording is as follows:<br>
<b>"[Album title] is a music album by [circle] released on [date + event]. It is a vocal album featuring arrangements from [games]"</b><br>
It looks fine on the surface, but there are a couple of things about it that feel a bit unnatural, especially the second sentence:<br>
-<i>"Music album."</i> The 'music' in 'music album' feels a bit redundant, and I personally feel that 'album' is more widely used than 'music album.' <br>
-<i>"It is a vocal album."</i> This doesn't stick out that much, but I think it would sound smoother if rewritten as 'It features vocal arrangements...' I also think it would lead to better balance between the two sentences.<br>
-<i>"arrangements from [games]."</i> Again, this looks like it makes sense, but it actually doesn't. As it is currently, the phrase implies that the arrangements <i>themselves</i> appear in the games, which they generally don't. This would be clearer if rewritten as 'arrangements of themes from [games]'<br>
So, with that in mind, I'd like to propose a new template with some minor changes:<br>
<b>"[Album title] is an album by [circle] released on [date + event]. It features vocal <i>[and/or instrumental where necessary]</i> arrangements of themes from [games]"</b>
This also would allow for greater consistency, as the template accommodates albums with arrangements of themes from a single game or multiple games.<br>
It would be a big ask to suggest going through and changing all of the past pages, but I'd like to propose that this be made the standard for future pages. Does anyone have any thoughts/feedback? <a href="../User_Biggest_Dreamer.html" title="User:Biggest Dreamer">Biggest Dreamer</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Biggest_Dreamer.html" title="User talk:Biggest Dreamer">talk</a>) 10:55, 17 July 2016 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Thinking back to when I started editing not too long ago I also thought the wording was unnatural but went along with it anyways, looking at your suggestions I have to agree that there is room for improvement. To talk about the logistics of your proposal, the summaries are composed of the template generated first sentence using the filled out template fields while the second and so on sentences are entirely user editor generated. This miss-match of editor formatting and template auto formatting is why the sentences sound so unnatural together. As far as changing that, the first sentence can be changed across all albums instantly since it's part of the template and not the "description" field, where as the second sentence would have to be changed manually. Changing the second sentence can be done in an orderly fashion if a handful of editors decided to truly offer their time (I'm a given of course).</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Now to talk about the specific proposals I think we should use "Doujin album" since I agree that "Music album" is redundant but also think that "album" is too bare. I was put off by the proposed second sentence at first but it's without a doubt more accurate than the original so I have no reason not to change it. My only concern is about it's flexibility since the editor doesn't have much access to the first sentence, but I've been wanting to experiment with adding a field that removed the first sentence entirely while retaining to appropriate categories for cases where you need more control. I'll probably experiment with adding another field for "Original" albums while I'm at it since groups like <a href="../BUTAOTOME.html" class="mw-redirect" title="BUTAOTOME">BUTAOTOME</a> (who's page I look to as the standard) have non-Touhou albums with pages that show up in the <i>Arrangement</i> CDs category, this issue could also be fixed at the same time.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The "MusicArticle" template is above my user level to edit and it is kind of a big change to make with only 2 users input anyways so please chime in if you're reading this and make you opinion known. <a href="../User_Ycdtosa.html" title="User:Ycdtosa">Ycdtosa</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Ycdtosa.html" title="User talk:Ycdtosa">talk</a>) 15:51, 18 July 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I generally agree with your proposal, especially the second sentence changing "arrangements from [games]" to "arrangements of themes from [games]"; the former has always felt weird to me. (Also, I personally think just "album" is fine over "music album" or "doujin album".) <a href="../User_Tsuukasa5" title="User:Tsuukasa5">Tsuukasa5</a> (<a href="../../indexfb09.php?title=User_talk:Tsuukasa5&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Tsuukasa5 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:41, 18 July 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Thanks for the feedback on my idea! If 'album' by itself is too bare, I agree that 'doujin album' is an acceptable substitute for 'music album.' If more people end up providing feedback on the second sentence, I'm also happy to take the time to update a couple of circles. <a href="../User_Biggest_Dreamer.html" title="User:Biggest Dreamer">Biggest Dreamer</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Biggest_Dreamer.html" title="User talk:Biggest Dreamer">talk</a>) 10:33, 19 July 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Okay so here are some test cases of the proposed new format in action, <a href="../Fragile_Sacrifice" title="Fragile Sacrifice">Fragile Sacrifice</a>, <a href="../BLUE_NOTE_%e6%9d%b1%e6%96%b9_Vol.1" title="BLUE NOTE 東方 Vol.1">BLUE NOTE 東方 Vol.1</a> &amp; <a href="../Monologue%ef%bd%9e%e9%ad%94%e6%b3%95%e3%81%8c%e8%a7%a3%e3%81%91%e3%82%8b%e3%81%9d%e3%81%ae%e5%89%8d%e3%81%ab%ef%bd%9e" title="Monologue～魔法が解けるその前に～">Monologue～魔法が解けるその前に～</a>. It's really not a huge change but since I plan to go around changing all the albums over to this format I want to be sure it's the best format we can come up with, anyone have any more input?</dd>
<dd>I also went ahead and looked up some stuff to try and fix some issues I would normally run into while editing, <a href="../User_Ycdtosa/Sandbox" title="User:Ycdtosa/Sandbox">here's</a> a slightly modified version of the MusicArticle template I used for the 3 pages that fixed some issues I would have run into with the normal template. I'll quickly outline the changes and on what pages you can see them in effect.</dd>
<dd>- fixed the issue of broken code showing up at the bottom of the page if the "groupCat" field is left empty, <a href="../Fragile_Sacrifice" title="Fragile Sacrifice">Fragile Sacrifice</a> makes use of this.</dd>
<dd>- added "no_intro" parameter so the pages begins with the "description", <a href="../BLUE_NOTE_%e6%9d%b1%e6%96%b9_Vol.1" title="BLUE NOTE 東方 Vol.1">BLUE NOTE 東方 Vol.1</a> makes use of this.</dd>
<dd>- added "banner_res" parameter for custom banner sizes, option to enter "Original CDs" into the "musictype" parameter for various changes and fixed the issue that albums with only the Japanese title had. <a href="../Monologue%ef%bd%9e%e9%ad%94%e6%b3%95%e3%81%8c%e8%a7%a3%e3%81%91%e3%82%8b%e3%81%9d%e3%81%ae%e5%89%8d%e3%81%ab%ef%bd%9e" title="Monologue～魔法が解けるその前に～">Monologue～魔法が解けるその前に～</a> makes use of all these.</dd>
<dd>- plus some other minor changes/clean up</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I'm not a native speaker, so take my style advices with a grain of salt :). I, however, agree about the second sentence completely. Your version is better.</dd>
<dd>As of the first sentence, I might be the one who wrote that part of the template a long time ago. On the second thought, "music album" does sound a bit redundant in English. "Doujin album" is better. I'd avoid capitalizing word "doujin" like it's done above, though. "Album" sounds ok, but I'd rather not omit "doujin" if reader is not familiar with doujin music phenomenon (the omission is also a problem with existing articles).</dd>
<dd>Speaking of mass page editing, I've done something similar with AutoWikibot, which can save a lot of time. I may be able to help this time, too. Using special bot account can also prevent RecentChanges from being cluttered when doing so. --<a href="../User_WGH.html" title="User:WGH">WGH</a> (<a href="../User_talk_WGH" title="User talk:WGH">talk</a>) 14:01, 23 July 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Eh. I just don't see "music album" as particularly redundant, given that you can have albums that aren't "music" albums. Such as "drama" albums, though they're not as common in Touhou. Still, the distinction should remain for that purpose. Honestly, I think it's addressing a problem that I don't think exists. But anyway, if anything I would like to include "doujin" or "official" in "music album" in the header, depending if it is an official release by ZUN or Tasofro. So an example page would read "[Album Title] is a doujin/official music album by [Circle]. It features vocal and instrumental arrangements of themes from [Game Titles]."</dd>
<dd>Anyway, back to my first point, it seems as if <a href="../Monologue%ef%bd%9e%e9%ad%94%e6%b3%95%e3%81%8c%e8%a7%a3%e3%81%91%e3%82%8b%e3%81%9d%e3%81%ae%e5%89%8d%e3%81%ab%ef%bd%9e" title="Monologue～魔法が解けるその前に～">Monologue～魔法が解けるその前に～</a> might fit the bill for a drama album, and as such might be titled [Album Title] is an original drama doujin album by [Circle]. <a href="../User_UTW.html" title="User:UTW">UTW</a> 10:39, 24 July 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It seems like to me that "doujin album" and even "music album" are a little too verbose.  I think "album" fits the bill a little better, and it keeps the formula a little more standardized with other websites. <a href="../User_Code_Slasher.html" title="User:Code Slasher">Code Slasher</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Code_Slasher.html" title="User talk:Code Slasher">talk</a>) 01:32, 25 July 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>@WGH I've un-capitalized doujin as you suggested, that was a mistake on my part because I was under the impression it was proper noun. That doesn't seem to be the case so thank you for correcting that. There seem to be universal consensus about the second sentence so if you would be able to use a bot to make the change that would be great, from there we would only have to go through the album pages looking for any that might have fallen through the cracks.</dd>
<dd>@UTW The change you requested for official albums has been added to the test template, <a href="../Monologue%ef%bd%9e%e9%ad%94%e6%b3%95%e3%81%8c%e8%a7%a3%e3%81%91%e3%82%8b%e3%81%9d%e3%81%ae%e5%89%8d%e3%81%ab%ef%bd%9e" title="Monologue～魔法が解けるその前に～">Monologue～魔法が解けるその前に～</a> is in the same format as <a href="../Kimino-museum.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Kimino-museum">kimino-museum</a>'s other original works and would be better described as a rock opera/concept album. But with the addition of the "no_intro" parameter non-standard albums can all be defined in the first sentence. I don't mind going with just "album" but I feel it's a wasted opportunity since nowhere is doujin even mentioned on any of the album pages, as WGH pointed out, that omission is a problem and including a link in the first sentence would fix it across all concerned pages.</dd>
<dd>@Code Slasher Wikipedia uses the term "studio album" which is where I got the idea to use "doujin album" for this wiki, I'm curious what other sites you're are referring to with regards to standardizing.</dd>
<dd>I don't have the user rights to edit <a href="../Template_MusicArticle.html" title="Template:MusicArticle">Template:MusicArticle</a> so another user will have to implement the appropriate template changes. I'll make a post on it's talk page with a full change log since many of them are separate issues from the album summary, before that I'd like to get the "album"/"doujin album" thing sorted first, as for me I feel it's important to include doujin and that music album is redundant but it's not my call to make alone. <a href="../User_Ycdtosa.html" title="User:Ycdtosa">Ycdtosa</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Ycdtosa.html" title="User talk:Ycdtosa">talk</a>) 12:28, 25 July 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Right now we're using only last official sprite for characters pages, so this solution has come to my mind.

</p>
<dl><dd>I know I have seen this sort of thing before somewhere....  There should be a way to make it load the last tab.  The only thing is that with the way you have it set up, it messes with the browser's history, i.e. it makes it harder to go back or forward pages. <a href="../User_Code_Slasher.html" title="User:Code Slasher">Code Slasher</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Code_Slasher.html" title="User talk:Code Slasher">talk</a>) 02:08, 12 August 2016 (UTC)

I don't know whether they are actually conflated in practice (in either Japanese or Chinese), but yeah it's pretty clear this is what is meant regardless, and is how it is interpreted on nicopedia at the very least. A more correct title would then be something like "Adoration of Magic" or "Devotion to Magic".

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Thoughts_on_MusicArticle_and_Circle_template_changes">Thoughts on MusicArticle and Circle template changes</span></h2>
<p>There are a couple things I've realized would be useful for the MusicArticle template and the Circle template so I figured I would list my thoughts and also ask if anyone else has any ideas. 
</p>
<ul><li>MusicArticle template ideas
<ul><li>A parameter for replacing the word "album" in the first auto generated sentence before the "description" parameter with whatever you want, mini-album, voice drama, DVD, etc.</li>
<li>An override for the headers of each credit parameter if you begin with a semi colon, credits don't always fit neatly into the fields so being able to name them is useful.</li>
<li><a href="../User_Unknwn.html" title="User:Unknwn">User:Unknwn</a> said to me once that fitting the track credits into a template would be useful for other language wikis. In reality it wouldn't be too hard to extend the Track template to include the standard credits, Arranger, Lyrics, Vocals, Other, along with the original title etc. At that point you could also have the first sentence (It features vocal and instrumental arrangements of...)  be auto generated if you wanted. I think at that point it becomes allot of work though, so I really don't want to even try unless it would actually help other language wikis.</li>
<li>Using tables to give the option of splitting the credits into two or more columns like on <a href="../Palette%ef%bd%9e%e4%ba%ba%e3%80%85%e3%81%8c%e6%84%9b%e3%81%97%e3%81%9f%e5%b9%bb%e6%83%b3%e9%83%b7%ef%bd%9e.html" title="Palette～人々が愛した幻想郷～">palette～人々が愛した幻想郷～</a> or <a href="../Groove_into_the_Night.html" title="Groove into the Night">Groove into the Night</a>.</li>
<li>Option of text bellow album covers to mention who the character on it is/whatever else might be useful there.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>Circle template ideas
<ul><li>Wikipedia lists "Associated acts" and I think we should find somewhere to list associated circles since there are circles who might often play live together, or regularly split booths at conventions, or appear on the same collaboration works, but rarely actually collaborate on albums. Not to mention it would be useful for the circles who do regularly appear on each other's albums, it can already be done using the description permitted but I wanted to bring it up since maybe there's somewhere nicer to put it, like an infobox or something.</li>
<li>Additional discography sections and greater control over the main discography section, it shouldn't be so hard for editors to add additional discographies. I've seen other's try to do it and while it's not hard if you already know how the circle template works it really should be a feature in the first place. Also the discography section as it is now needs to be updated in some way, currently it only accounts for 99 albums, <a href="../TAMUSIC.html" title="TAMUSIC">TAMUSIC</a> has 98 on their page right now. The template could be updated to account for more albums, or we could just make it limitless, I actually don't know why it was capped in the first place since looking at the wikimark up it would be easier to just have it be limitless. You would have allot more freedom to add headers and text to the discography sections if it was formatted differently so it makes no sense to my why it's like this in the first place...</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>Circle name template for Japanese names
<ul><li>So basically this is a step up from the hover text templates we have been using for names on music pages recently, it's first function would be like a regular name template so that if the circle's official English name changed it could be updated everywhere at once. We can also use it to updated a category across a number of pages if we also use it to tag files, it would basically give editors allot more confidence to build up categories knowing that it wouldn't actually be so hard to update it if the circle announces an official English name or if the editor is uncertain of how their name should be romanticized.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p><br>
Those are the ideas I've had so far, I will eventually start messing around with the templates so feel free to give any comments or criticisms of the changes I'm thinking of making, and of course any ideas you might have yourself. <a href="../User_Ycdtosa.html" title="User:Ycdtosa">Ycdtosa</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Ycdtosa.html" title="User talk:Ycdtosa">talk</a>) 07:32, 25 July 2017 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_music_themes_section_of_character_info_boxes">The music themes section of character info boxes</span></h2>
<p>Currently, in the character info boxes, the music themes are written out in Japanese, with mouseover text displaying the English title. For character titles, this is the other way around, and I want to recall that the character titles used to be in Japanese with English mouseover, but it was decided to change this at some point. So now I wonder - why not make this same change to the musical themes? I'm fairly sure that the majority of wiki users don't actually know Japanese, and so seeing the English titles first would be more useful to them, and the goal of this wiki should be to present the information in a way optimized for English-speaking users, no? Since the music themes are already hidden behind an [Expand] link, length shouldn't be an issue (and shouldn't be an issue even if it wasn't, tbh). So for the same reasons that character titles in the info box were changed to show English first, I propose that we apply the same logic to the music theme names and change those to show up in English with Japanese mouseover text. <a href="../User_KennyMan666" title="User:KennyMan666">KennyMan666</a> (<a href="../User_talk_KennyMan666" title="User talk:KennyMan666">talk</a>) 11:54, 13 August 2017 (UTC)

<dl><dd>The problem is that most of the music themes appear as Japanese text in the games (barring a language patch).

<dl><dd>Everything appear as Japanese text in the games if you're not using a translation patch. Including the character titles, which we chose to write out in English first with the Japanese text available as mouseover. So that argument doesn't really hold water. I'm talking about specifically the music themes section in the info box on character pages, which <i>already</i> have both Japanese and English text - the latter as mouseover. I am simply suggesting we swap those around, so the more useful of the two shows up first - just like we did with character titles. <a href="../User_KennyMan666" title="User:KennyMan666">KennyMan666</a> (<a href="../User_talk_KennyMan666" title="User talk:KennyMan666">talk</a>) 18:40, 20 August 2017 (UTC)

I always thought they were kind of pointless on Wikipedia, but because of the the very formulaic nature of some doujin releases like Touhou Keyboard Cat, Another World (GITR VS TUMENECO) or even Alstroemeria's POP CULTURE series I think it could be beneficial to us here, plus I think it looks very good personally.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I would also like to know how you feel about the chronology section's implementation from an editor perspective, currently it's set up with 3 variables; the name of the chronology, the previous release and the next release (an override "chrono_curr" can be used to specify the current release explicitly). An alternate implementation would be to centralize all the releases on one template and have the specific albums simply call on that template and specify the album's position in the series, the outcome would be the same on the reader's end but for the editors things would be less cluttered but a little more involved. Do you have any preference between the handcrafted vs centralized implementations?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Currently the template only supports one chronology at a time, I think that's sufficient since from my understanding it will be used for specific album series as apposed to being paired with complete circle chronologies (as I do believe that would be pointless). <a href="../User_Ycdtosa.html" title="User:Ycdtosa">Ycdtosa</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Ycdtosa.html" title="User talk:Ycdtosa">talk</a>) 03:06, 24 August 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>That's exactly what I had in mind! Awesome work there, like usual. I tried test editing the next album in the series using your template, and it was simple to add the releases in. With a lot of them, we'd only be changing a number here or there, so I don't think manually adding each release in would be too much trouble. Of course, I'm happy to have a look at other options, too! For now, though, the chronology you put together looks clean and works perfectly, and I think it will be a good way for people to easily browse through specific album series quickly. <a href="../User_Biggest_Dreamer.html" title="User:Biggest Dreamer">Biggest Dreamer</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Biggest_Dreamer.html" title="User talk:Biggest Dreamer">talk</a>) 03:49, 24 August 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Great, it's good to know I could be of help. Personally I like the handcrafted approach in place now so I'll leave the chronology section as is. The current test template appears to be stable, so after some more "field testing" and maybe more discussion/other user feedback it should be ready for complete adoption fairly soon. <a href="../User_Ycdtosa.html" title="User:Ycdtosa">Ycdtosa</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Ycdtosa.html" title="User talk:Ycdtosa">talk</a>) 04:40, 24 August 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I was told that adding the tracks on music articles to a template with separate fields for arranger, lyricist, etc would be beneficial for adapting these pages to other languages, is this the case? I've already set up the template (using the sandbox) that would function the same as normal but would allow for separate fields like this;
</p>
<pre>*{{Track|0|{{lang|ja|}}|:|lyrics=Lyrics: 
| english title = ''___''
| arrangement = 
| lyricist = {{lang|ja|}}
| vocals = {{lang|ja|}}
| other = 
| original title = {{lang|ja|}}
| source = {{}}
}}
</pre>
<p><br>
as apposed to what we currently use; 
</p>
<pre>*{{Track|0|{{lang|ja|}}|:|lyrics=Lyrics: }}
**''___''
**arrangement: 
**lyrics: {{lang|ja|}}
**vocals: {{lang|ja|}}
**original title: {{lang|ja|}}
**source: {{}}
</pre>
<p><br>
If it will indeed help other language wiki's please let me know as I'd be happy to update the Track template, but if it won't really make a difference I don't see a reason to change it. Let me know if you see any other reasons to change or not to change the format. <a href="../User_Ycdtosa.html" title="User:Ycdtosa">Ycdtosa</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Ycdtosa.html" title="User talk:Ycdtosa">talk</a>) 14:07, 24 August 2017 (UTC)

<p>I ran into a problem while trying to make the <a href="../Template_ArrangementTable" title="Template:ArrangementTable">Arrangement Table</a> template look better by putting the table inside a navbox, I got the idea from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Navbox_with_columns" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Template:Navbox with columns">Wikipedia:Template:Navbox with columns</a>. The problem is that for whatever reason word wrapping stops working on links inside tables inside navboxs. From what I can tell it's normal for links to not wrap inside of navboxs, but is there some kind of workaround to force word wrapping or exempt the table from the navbox's settings?
</p><p>I'll put an example of the problem it causes for the Arrangement table template (simplified version) <a href="../Template_Diao_ye_zong_Guest_Arrangements" title="Template:Diao ye zong Guest Arrangements">here</a>. <a href="../User_Ycdtosa.html" title="User:Ycdtosa">Ycdtosa</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Ycdtosa.html" title="User talk:Ycdtosa">talk</a>) 20:45, 21 September 2017 (UTC)

<dl><dd>It was a simpler solution that I thought, short answer is just us &lt;span style="white-space:normal;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; if anyone was wondering. <a href="../User_Ycdtosa.html" title="User:Ycdtosa">Ycdtosa</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Ycdtosa.html" title="User talk:Ycdtosa">talk</a>) 20:20, 25 September 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h2><span id="Music_Related_Template_Changes_(Circle,_Track,_MusicArticle)"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Music_Related_Template_Changes_.28Circle.2C_Track.2C_MusicArticle.29">Music Related Template Changes (Circle, Track, MusicArticle)</span></h2>
<p>It might have been presumptuous of me but I've updated the circle template and the documentation to use a discography parameter as apposed to individual album parameters. The documentation now notates that individual album parameters are deprecated like the use of the arrange parameter and should be updated. I was hoping for more feedback on this before changing anything but after more than a month I've yet to receive any comments on the topic, as far as I can tell there's no good reason to use numbered parameters, album numbers can be commented in if editors think it helps readability.
</p><p>Before I go ahead and make another change I really do <i>need</i> feedback on the track template, I've had people tell me breaking it all down into a template would be useful for other language wikis but I don't know since I don't contribute to any. I do think it would be good to include the rest of the track information into the template either way, but I'm leaning towards just using a different template name like FullTrack and making it the new standard. The new template would be used kind of like this; 
</p>
<pre>{{FullTrack|0|{{lang|ja|}}|:|lyrics=Lyrics:

<p>Since I'm posting on the talk page anyways I'll mention that I'll be updating the MusicArticle template with some new "icing on top" features after I test it a little, see my user page for a testcase showing the features. <a href="../User_Ycdtosa.html" title="User:Ycdtosa">Ycdtosa</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Ycdtosa.html" title="User talk:Ycdtosa">talk</a>) 20:20, 25 September 2017 (UTC)

<h2><span id="Hecatia/Junko_invincible_during_non-spells"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Hecatia.2FJunko_invincible_during_non-spells">Hecatia/Junko invincible during non-spells</span></h2>
<p>Since there is no talk page on LoLK yet I'm posting it here
</p><p>So I was trying to beat the extra stage of Touhou 15 and I came across a glitch that isn't mentioned on the Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom/Gameplay/Glitches list:
So I came to Spell Card 116: Moon "Lunatic Impact", which I usually have trouble with, and accidently timed it out because I used too many of Sanae's bombs which makes the boss invincible. Now that's okay since I wasn't expecting a capture anyway. But here's the thing, the moment the time ran out another bomb was used so the time ran out while hecatia was still invincible, and when she left, Junko for some reason became invincible for the whole duration of her non-spell. I then wasted many bombs and lives because I can't get through one wave. And when it was timed out she was still invincible but then I bombed again and then she was not invincible anymore. I'm not really sure if anyone has come across this glitch as well but it actually scared me because it was on the hardest non-spell and I didn't know about this glitch before so it might be a good idea to add it to the LoLK buglist so that others will know about it as well if they don't:
</p><p>'<b>Extra stage boss invincible during non-spells</b>: When you bomb while the timer runs out on a spell card the extra boss becomes invincible for the whole duration of the fight, this can be fixed by bombing on another spell card' or something like that. <a href="../User_Raymario_Pok%c3%a9nic.html?title=User:Raymario_Pok%C3%A9nic&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Raymario Pokénic (page does not exist)">Raymario Pokénic</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Raymario_Pok%c3%a9nic.html?title=User_talk:Raymario_Pok%C3%A9nic&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Raymario Pokénic (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 12:29, 4 November 2017 (UTC)

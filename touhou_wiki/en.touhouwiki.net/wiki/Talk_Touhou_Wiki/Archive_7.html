<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Books_backcovers">Books backcovers</span></h2>
<p>I own most of the official touhou printworks(Except Inaba of the Moon and the semi-official fanbook), and all the official windows touhou shooter games up to now. I updated a few book covers, mainly for the three fairies series, but I was wondering if there was a way to get to show the backcover of the books without being invasive in the pages. Uploading it together with the frontcover in the preview picture makes it very stretched and small. I could upload the backcovers of the books as well as those of the games. <a href="../User_Sefam.html" title="User:Sefam">Sefam</a> 12:40, 11 May 2011 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I'm OK with the additions, but the images are a little too big file size-wise for something that is used for illustrative purposes only. If possible, try to keep their file size under 500kb. <a href="../User_Master_Bigode.html" title="User:Master Bigode">Master Bigode</a> 20:32, 11 May 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>They're big but I'm thinking it won't be a problem, since you normally see them already resized (and resized images are cached anyway).  <a href="../User_Momiji.html" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Momiji">Momiji</a> 21:04, 11 May 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>What Momiji said. Just to specify; the thumbnail pictures are under 50kb, and the preview pictures(When you click on the thumbnail), are under 150kb. You only get the bigger file size if you decide to check the full resolution version, in which case I think the quality is a good thing to have. Unless the wiki's hosting can't handle the size of the images. If that's really a problem, I can either resize them or lower their quality. <a href="../User_Sefam.html" title="User:Sefam">Sefam</a> 21:40, 11 May 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>For certain things it's best.  For images with smooth color gradients (like photographs, in general) JPEG is best.  For images with lots of repeating patterns and whatnot, in places you'd previously use GIF for, or if you need transparency support, use PNG.  <a href="../User_Momiji.html" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Momiji">Momiji</a> 16:42, 14 May 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Funny_Party_in_the_fog_translation">Funny Party in the fog translation</span></h2>
<p>Hello.  I've recently discovered a fantastic CD via youtube.com called "Funny Party in the fog".  I would like to know what the lyrics are in English (Romaji and English preferably) so I've been going around and asking people how I could get these songs translated.  Since this is the Touhou hub of the west, I figured this would be a good place to ask around.  If I've asked in the wrong area, please forgive me.  I've never joined a wiki community before.  Thanks for any help that can be given. <small>—Preceding unsigned comment added by <a href="../User_Flanchan" title="User:Flanchan">Flanchan</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Flanchan" title="User talk:Flanchan">talk</a> • <a href="../Special_Contributions/Flanchan" title="Special:Contributions/Flanchan">contribs</a>) </small>
</p>
<dl><dd>The article for it is <a href="../Funny_party_in_the_Fog.html" title="Funny party in the Fog">here</a>, but as you can see, no lyrics are up yet. Maybe someone who owns a copy will add the lyrics some day. If you add the red links to your watchlist (click the star at the top of the page, near the edit button), and enable e-mail notifications in your preferences, you'll be notified via e-mail that those pages have been edited. <a href="../User_Master_Bigode.html" title="User:Master Bigode">Master Bigode</a> 22:56, 19 May 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Thank you for the response.  I'll keep an eye on the page.  I'm currently looking around for someone who can translate the CD (or at least song 4...so amazing), so if I get any translations before touhouwiki.net does, I'll be sure to share.  --<a href="../User_Flanchan" title="User:Flanchan">Flanchan</a> 04:56, 24 May 2011 (UTC)
</p><p>As a follow up to my post, I can't find anywhere online to BUY the CD.  I've found youtube videos and a few download sites, but I want to OWN the CD.  It's that epic.  The only thing is I don't speak Japanese and the English sites that have Japanese stuff (Touhou in particular) don't carry it.  Any suggestions?--<a href="../User_Flanchan" title="User:Flanchan">Flanchan</a> 05:23, 25 June 2011 (UTC)

</p><p>Don't worry about the actual translations themselves, I just want to be able to make the files responsible to make this happen.

</p>
<dl><dd>First off, if you ask a generic question like "how do I create patch", chances are you're probably pretty far away from creating one.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Applying external modifications to a compiled application is just one area of "hacking", and thus requires a comprehensive knowledge on how the program in question, and programs in general, operate. And as every program, and therefore every patch, is different, there's also no "surefire way" to create a patch.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>This also explains why your Google searches failed. Nobody can help you if you just ask a generic question like this. See, even I might have misunderstood your question, and you want something entirely different.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I can only suggest you to learn a compiled programming language, ideally C, from start to finish. (Watch out that you learn _only_ C, not C++, at first. All that object-oriented extra stuff may be used by some games, but is not guaranteed to help you much in that regard). Depending of what you want to patch, you may need to learn the basics of assembly language as well.</dd>
<dd>And after practicing a bit, the basic workflow of "creating a patch" <i>should come to you naturally</i>. If you still need help with specifics then, some hackers will certainly be willing to help you.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>If you want to see how such a patch may look like, I recommend taking a look at the source code and technical documentation of the <a href="../Game_Tools_and_Modifications.html#Touhou_Vorbis_Compressor" title="Game Tools and Modifications">Touhou Vorbis Compressor</a>. I documented all the aspects involved in designing and creating a patch like this. It's a fairly simple patch when compared to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://iamp.mizuumi.net/wiki/Rollcaster">other, more complicated patches</a>. If you really want to be able create a patch, you should have no problem understanding this documentation. --<a href="../User_NamelessLegacy.html" title="User:NamelessLegacy">NamelessLegacy</a> 11:24, 22 May 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<h2><span id="Other_Dead_language_wiki?"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_Dead_language_wiki.3F">Other Dead language wiki?</span></h2>
<p>OK, I have identified some of the "dead" wiki, here's the list:
</p>
<dl><dd><a href="https://de.touhouwiki.net/wiki/" class="extiw" title="de:">German</a>, <a href="https://es.touhouwiki.net/wiki/" class="extiw" title="es:">Spanish</a>, <a href="https://it.touhouwiki.net/wiki/" class="extiw" title="it:">Italian</a>, <a href="https://pt.touhouwiki.net/wiki/" class="extiw" title="pt:">Portuguese</a>, <a href="https://sv.touhouwiki.net/wiki/" class="extiw" title="sv:">Swedish</a>, and <a href="https://uk.touhouwiki.net/wiki/" class="extiw" title="uk:">Ukrainian</a></dd></dl>
<p>As of the list above, <i>sv</i> admin "promised" to write the content of the wiki when he's done with his exam. And now for the rest: <i>de</i> has been "declared" dead by <a href="../User_NamelessLegacy.html" title="User:NamelessLegacy">NamelessLegacy</a>, <i>es</i> and <i>pt</i>... well not quite dead, but rarely have some editor to come in. Finally, <i>it</i> and <i>uk</i>... I don't want to say so much but... the two person who requested us to open the related language wiki is gone, and the whole wiki is left empty for a few weeks, no edit activities occur.

<dl><dd>I think we should do at least two things to promote small wikis. First: finaly make global main page (<a href="Mainpage.html" title="Talk:Touhou Wiki/Mainpage">Talk:Touhou Wiki/Mainpage</a>). And second: enable interwiki panel expanded by default. Just like it's made in Wikipedia now. This panel is hidden by default in our wiki and so people don't notice it and are not aware of existence of other language wikis. For new wikis we should make incubator site as I've said before. <a href="../User_Coyc.html" title="User:Coyc">Coyc</a> 12:03, 19 June 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="wiki.net_vs_wikia">wiki.net vs wikia</span></h2>
<p>Which out of these two is the most populist? Why I ask is because wikia is just f****d up! Has anyone seen the info they provide on the characters pages? Such as comparing Sakuya and Youmu to Sonic and saying Patchouli was the one who created flandres wind, and even saying the wrong translation on one Japanese character? And most of it doesn't say if it's either canon of fanon. WTF zombie wiki? There isn't even good articles on Kyouko Kasodani, Yoshika Miyako and Ten Desires. Someone has to either get wikia to this wiki or close the wiki for good! (or at least get every English speaker across the globe who's a Touhou fan knowing about this wiki.) I mean, we also let users upload fan-made created stuff on the wiki (e.g. <a href="../Fiction.html" title="Fiction">Fiction</a> and <a href="../../index43fd.php?title=User:KiKi-KaiKai/My_Original_Touhou_Chars/Ryoukei_Tsuyoshin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:KiKi-KaiKai/My Original Touhou Chars/Ryoukei Tsuyoshin (page does not exist)">KiKi-KaiKai</a>'s OC (lol)). I also like to ask on why wiki.net is not yet at the top of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1T4GGHP_en-GBGB415GB417&amp;q=touhou+wiki">google</a>... --<a href="../User_Tony64.html" title="User:Tony64">Tony64</a> 11:54, 23 June 2011 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Simple answer: Touhou Wiki used to have Wikia as a host. Then we left. Due to Wikia's policies, it can't be closed. Due to past history, still on top of Google.

<dd>I guess <i>Touhou Project Wiki</i> (Old Wiki) was maintained once to copy &amp; add some ideas or sentences from this wiki.

<dd>They're at the top of Google right now, but we're the more active wiki, as far as edits and up to date information is concerned. In time search results <i>should</i> change to reflect this. Unfortunately, Wikia is also an arm of Wikipedia, and is popular as a whole, which will likely always influence the results. Also, people are lazy. Even if they did know about us, they would still go for the first search hit, which isn't us.</dd>
<dd>I'm concerned that they'll feed the fans bad information, but we have nothing to do with them anymore, so it's not like we can do anything about it.

<dd>The title is 東方紅魔郷Ex　裏2周目突入 (of which I can only made out the first part as "EoSD Ex".) The Ultra-mode one is called 東方紅魔郷Ultraモード (EoSD Ultra mode). TAS = Tool-assisted (whether by slowing down the game or by using save states).</dd>

<dd>If it takes longer to display when such a feature is added, we should stop and consider, because, I think, one of the purposes of databases is the speediness on displaying the interface.

<dl><dd>Those other wikis are simply cluttered to begin with. We don't really have that problem. Social links there aren't the thing making the difference between messy and clean or fast and slow and I don't think adding such here would make a significant difference in those things. I just question how much good it would ultimately do. If we really want to reach out we'd be better off making Twitter or Facebook accounts for the site, but I don't know if anyone would be willing to put time and effort into those. Twitter, at least, is worthless unless it's semi-frequently updated. Although we already have a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://twitter.com/touhouwiki">Twitter</a>, apparently, I guess.

<p>The "Official Profile" section of some characters are getting really long, but not everyone who comes here searching for information reads them.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>I just had a look at <a href="../Reimu.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Reimu">Reimu</a>'s page, and having the show/hide there has removed the sections from the table of contents. I'm not sure this is such a good idea... especially since if you want to skip past them you can just click "4 Book Synopsis" in the ToC, or just keep hitting pagedown/spacebar. <a href="../User_Keiji.html" title="User:Keiji">Keiji</a> 10:24, 7 February 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I see that as an advantage. My rationale: (1-about ToC) Not many people read the official profiles, at least not as much as the general information/story/fandom above it (and soon there will be "Spellcards" section). And thus, it should not occupy more space on the ToC than the other, more popular content. The fact that the pages are being restructured (not yet for Reimu), and the ToC would have more than just "General" and "Fun facts" further supports this. (2-about hiding) The "Official profiles" part serves mostly as a reference, people read it mainly when they are looking for it, thus it should not occupy more space on a page than information people come to "read" when they want to find out who Reimu is in general; and as such it makes perfect sense to hide it. The problem is not "going to the Book Synopsys section", but rather "The page is too long". <a href="../User_Jimreynold2nd.html" title="User:Jimreynold2nd">Dory</a> 21:20, 10 February 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I don't think not including a section of a page that you deem "unpopular" is ever good.

<dd>Thinking a little about it, the size of the message shouldn't be an issue if we only hide the profiles, but not the section headings. That would fix the TOC issue too. <a href="../User_Master_Bigode.html" title="User:Master Bigode">Master Bigode</a> 20:55, 12 February 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Why would someone put the section headings <i>inside</i> the toggle tags is beyond me.

<dl><dd>I believe it's that fact that you have to click on each individual profile to read it. For Reimu, this means a lot. I imagine most people who'd want to read the profiles would want to also read profiles from other games.

<dl><dd>Same. Though, that's usually cause the developers had too much on their plates with worldly matters and couldn't do it anymore. Or got bored. On the other hand, what if we made it so that everyone could freely contribute? Source code would be available to all so that even when the main coders aren't available others would still be able to continue development.

<dd>Incidentally, I've been hacking <a href="../Touhou_Mother.html" title="Touhou Mother">Touhou Mother</a> to make more characters playable. That was mainly over Christmas though, and I haven't had time to work on it since... and goodness, the original code is <i>awful</i> from a programmer's perspective. It doesn't help that RM2k is not at all easy to work with in terms of scripting. <a href="../User_Keiji.html" title="User:Keiji">Keiji</a> 10:21, 7 February 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I am not sure what engine we should use. Does anyone have any preferences? I got RMXP cause that seemed pretty popular although a lot of people seem to be using VX instead. After 5 hours of fooling around I figured out enough of the basics to get some game logic going and just started to look at RGSS scripting lol <small>—Preceding unsigned comment added by <a href="../User_Tsukihime.html" title="User:Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Tsukihime.html" title="User talk:Tsukihime">talk</a> • <a href="../Special_Contributions/Tsukihime.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tsukihime">contribs</a>) 13:50, 7 February 2011 (UTC)</small>
<dl><dd>I've heard from a friend of mine who's experienced with the various RM versions that XP is actually better than VX, apparently for the sake of being "idiot friendly" they took out some useful things when they made VX. But I haven't personally used anything but 2k. <a href="../User_Keiji.html" title="User:Keiji">Keiji</a> 18:10, 7 February 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I stuck to XP because of the ability to change battle backgrounds on the fly. With VX, changing backgrounds during the battle is pretty difficult (if not impossible). Especially for a touhou-themed game, I can't imagine how you would show that a boss is using a Last Word spell card or not if you used the same background for everything! But there are a lot of nice scripts available for XP. Can you believe this is scripted in RPG maker? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQwViGmy8Ao">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQwViGmy8Ao</a>. Well aside from the fact that XP has been out longer than VX and therefore logically would have more scripts, there are a lot of people that are split between "should I go do everything for this new script-engine or not?" --<a href="../User_Tsukihime.html" title="User:Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a> 05:09, 10 February 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>For XP, I'm not surprised, XP was a huge overhaul. But as for "changing backgrounds during the battle", I will just point out that Touhou Mother doesn't use RM's built-in battle system at all - it uses a map for the battle screen, "events" for each digit and player name/sprite and "Pictures" for the enemy sprites and the entire menu (S-chan was obviously using a modded RM2k for this, because he goes up to Picture #50 - I had to ResHack my copy to get it to work).</dd>
<dd>Anyway, that specific case aside, I'd wager it's easier to just make your battle scene like this using a map than to do it in an actual RM2k battle - RM2k battles aren't even Turing-complete (though are annoyingly close to it!).</dd>
<dd>Plus when it comes down to it it'd probably just be easier to use Game Maker (I like to be retro and stick with 5.3A, but while 7 isn't much more advanced I heard 8 is much better for special effects) than any version of RPG Maker. <a href="../User_Keiji.html" title="User:Keiji">Keiji</a> 14:31, 15 February 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd><b>No. You are not replacing a battle engine with a bunch of "events" and "pictures" accessing your random set of switches and variables.</b> Anyone who ever did object-oriented programming will agree that this concept goes against all present structures and requires a huge amount of braindead low-level managing. As a comparison, it's like developing the game itself in your favorite programming language, while writing the battle system in pure assembly. (Besides, RMXP adds a huge overhead of Ruby processing to each event, which probably makes the resulting system feel incredibly slow.)</dd>
<dd>RMXP gives you scripting functionality which directly lets you modify the battle engine on the same programming level it was made on. This will allow you object-oriented access and modification of all the data you possibly want to use and then some. You can even use all the data you can edit in the database, which wasn't possible with 2k. And adding a feature for changing backgrounds during battle should only require a bit of searching what to modify in the scripts, writing a function, and then calling it from the event scripts when necessary.</dd>
<dd>Seriously, this is why I won't recommend using RPG Maker 2000/2003. Besides, that engine is over 10 years old now. Seeing people still recommending (!) wasting lots of time and organization effort in creating a pseudo-engine based on this event system makes me rage.</dd>
<dd>tl;dr: Keep the events for simple, plot-driving stuff, and don't use them for complex UI systems. You have a scripting engine for that. --<a href="../User_NamelessLegacy.html" title="User:NamelessLegacy">NamelessLegacy</a> 15:08, 15 February 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>What are you getting so worked up about? S-chan DID replace a battle system with a bunch of events and pictures, there's no denying that. Sure, it's a bad programming paradigm, but if RM2k is all you can use, it's the best you can do, and in fact it's rather innovative! But as I said, I'd recommend Game Maker over RPG Maker anyway. <a href="../User_Keiji.html" title="User:Keiji">Keiji</a> 10:28, 17 February 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Someone on RPGRPGRevolution forums (large forums for RM games, scripts, and resources) wanted to make a complex active time battle system similar to star ocean or the tales series. People recommended Game Maker over RM. Anyone have experience with Game Maker?

<p>Oh dear god RPG Maker....good for some things, but otherwise very limited in what it can let you do. I've been working on my own TH RPG for the past 2 years now, and still only 50% done. Mainly due to how limited the system is, I can't do half of what I wanted to do with it. VX/XP are good yes, but you'll probably have to make all of the resources yourselves, as I recall there being not that many resources for either of those. I'd stick with 2k3, but again, it's limited with what you can and can't do (enemies don't have levels, damage formula is wack for physical attack, don't even have magic defense, etc....). Just so much that COULD have been done, but WASN'T done...but that's my two cents on this. <a href="../User_Xenomic.html" title="User:Xenomic">Xenomic</a> 08:37, 10 February 2011 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>That's true. Then again, in the worst case, we'd go ahead and write custom scripts to accomplish what is wanted. For me, I don't really want to write a game engine from scratch just to get certain things I wanted in. There are probably other game engines that do provide the kind of features that would be sought for though --<a href="../User_Tsukihime.html" title="User:Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a> 15:00, 10 February 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Perhaps, though it also depends on how in-depth you WANT to go too I suppose.

<dl><dd>Derivative would be a good term that would encompass all of them.

<dl><dd>Why would we seperate doujin stuff and fanworks? When speaking about Touhou, those doujin mangas/albums/games are always made by fans, so there's no difference. Or are you implying a difference in quality between those two terms just because (what we currently have as) doujin stuff is usually sold for money? Then I can assure you that there's excellent and terrible stuff on both sides. --<a href="../User_NamelessLegacy.html" title="User:NamelessLegacy">NamelessLegacy</a> 10:59, 20 February 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>About the sidebar, it's a bit confusing right now. I suggest moving <i>Fangames</i> (from Games), <i>Doujin music</i> (from Music) and <i>Fanfiction</i> (from Print Works) under Derivative Works.
</p><p>.. oh wait, that would leave Music with only one link, that being <a href="../Music_CDs.html" title="Music CDs">Official CDs</a>. Well, how about tossing in <a href="../Category_Music_by_Game.html" title="Category:Music by Game">Category: Music by Game</a>? I can imagine some people looking just for that in the sidebar.
</p><p>And about that doujin vs. fanworks argument, how about just omitting that prefix under the Derivative Works heading, since it's redundant anyway? So it would be just <i>Portal</i>, <i>Circles</i>, <i>Music</i>, <i>Fanfiction</i> and <i>Games</i>. --<a href="../User_NamelessLegacy.html" title="User:NamelessLegacy">NamelessLegacy</a> 10:59, 20 February 2011 (UTC)

</p><p>Just a few suggestions:
</p>
<ul><li>It's currently text-only. Maybe we should add icons for the game, music, and print work headers, and additionally for the single paragraphs.</li>
<li>I always forget which Akyu's Score volume corresponds to which game. Maybe we should indicate that</li>
<li>Fan music should link to the <a href="../Doujin_music.html" title="Doujin music">Doujin music</a> page only, because everything else is there</li>
<li>And as a hacker, I demand <a href="../Game_Tools_and_Modifications.html" title="Game Tools and Modifications">Game Tools and Modifications</a> to be linked under Other Articles again. --<a href="../User_NamelessLegacy.html" title="User:NamelessLegacy">NamelessLegacy</a> 10:59, 20 February 2011 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>Regarding color. I'll raise consistency as a concern. I wouldn't have as much of a problem with the color, if the rest of the wiki was in the same scheme, which it isn't. It's too different. The Naxboxes and Infoboxes both use similar colors, but both have a very light background color for the text. I will test this on the <a href="../Touhou_Wiki_Frontpage_modifications.html" title="Touhou Wiki:Frontpage modifications">'sandbox' version</a>. Tests can be viewed under the page history. After testing, I think that changing the background color to a lighter one would be sufficient. <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> 08:59, 22 February 2011 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I can second this sentiment.  It really is my only issue - we barely use colour formatting elsewhere on the wiki so we don't really need it here (Really, it could be fine even if the colours were just much 'softer' to fit with the exterior framing of the page, for instance).  Oh, and why are three specific game OSTs given their own special slots on the front page?

<dd>Anyway, what I wanna say is 1. superstition from similarity of number is fucking awful, there's no relation of Touhou and the earthquake. 2. That earthquake could be to Japanese people what the Hurricane Katrina to American, or by far biggest one, because the work of capital city (Toukyou) is now stopping, like electricity plants announced people in Toukyou must save electricity, because of plants' unability to be run.

<p>As an admin at Shrinemaiden.org, I'd like to state that if you take up Kiefmaster99's suggestion we're willing to link to it as an alternative to our own donation drive. KyoriAsh's userpage is rather unsightly and confusing, so it doesn't serve the purpose very well; ideally such a page would contain a short description of the various options, as well as warning that NicoDouga is in Japanese and perhaps providing a guide for foreigners to donate.
</p><p>Our apologies for any miscommunications that occurred on IRC. To clarify: TSO wants Maidens of the Kaleidoscope to remain acknowledged in the donation drive, as she feels she's putting her own resources and reputation on the line by having organized it, but we're quite willing to link back to you.

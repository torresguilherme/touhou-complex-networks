<p>Okay, after much deliberation over IRC, we've come to the conclusion that it's best if we revert to the original, vanilla phrasing of "Ability to X", when stated in the infobox, in profile translations and other instances where the short phrase is required. We will be attempting to create Ability sections for each character on their pages to explain each character's ability in detail. The short phrases will be attempted to be worded such that it is easy to understand for new readers, and they can read the paragraph for more detail. The awkward and ambiguous phrasing that ZUN uses and what it signifies will be detailed in the general Abilities page. Mainly, I'm posting this here so we can be perfectly clear that this is what we're planning on doing, and that there is a significant amount of consensus to put this into action. <a href="../User_Drake_Irving.html" title="User:Drake Irving">Drake Irving</a> 04:18, 1 May 2012 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>To clarify, it will be (for example) "Ability: Manipulation of fate" in profile translations and "Abilities <i>[space]</i> Manipulation of fate" in the infobox, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../../indexa936.html?title=Remilia_Scarlet&amp;oldid=220011">exactly how it used to be</a>. In the end, the only difference will be the addition of a full explanation of ZUN's phrasing to the <a href="../Characters/Abilities.html" title="Characters/Abilities">Abilities</a> page. <a href="../User_Kapow.html?title=User:Kapow&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Kapow (page does not exist)">Kapow</a> 04:29, 1 May 2012 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, it appears we had a discussion that came to a pleasant conclusion. (though the fact that it took over 2 months to effectively result in no overall change is amusingly disappointing) Basically, the more you want to know about the nuances of ZUNspeak, the more you'll have to dig into the wiki. Readers who don't know of or don't care about such vagueness won't be confused, and if you get curious, there'll be a nice blue link to click. Click on enough links and you'll learn more than you ever wanted to know. After all, isn't that purpose of a wiki? Of course, if anyone is curious about the discussion that occurred on IRC, go ahead and ask. Logs are available. <a href="../User_K.html" title="User:K">K</a> 04:34, 1 May 2012 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>For additional clarification, character pages will just use good old "Ability". Character pages will also have an Ability/Abilities section that will provide additional details about a character's abilities. The <a href="../Characters/Abilities.html" title="Characters/Abilities">main Abilities page</a> will illuminate and demystify <span lang="ja">程度の能力</span>. To make this information easy to access, <a href="../Characters/Abilities.html" title="Characters/Abilities">Characters/Abilities</a> should be linked on each character page. One good location to put this link would be the "Abilities:" header in the <a href="../Template_Infobox_Character.html" title="Template:Infobox Character">Infobox Character template</a>, which I will go ahead and do if nobody objects. <a href="../User_K.html" title="User:K">K</a> 05:22, 1 May 2012 (UTC)

<p>I've read both of the threads above this one and I want to say that the problem is that the wiki does not want to keep its front end simple at all, it wants to dump all its information on the reader at one time and shroud them in a cloud of confusion.
</p><p>The high priority pages should have clear and concise information. If the reader wants to look further into the details, you can create pages for those details and link them from there as brightly colored translation notes instead of putting that page's info and every other page's info on that profile. Let the reader explore as far as he or she wants or needs to, don't force them to read everything or "translate for themselves" just to get to the information they're after.--<a href="../User_Choja.html" title="User:Choja">Choja</a> 18:42, 30 April 2012 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Something I might suggest is to create a "Simple English" version of this wiki (somewhat like the Simple English Wikipedia) for people who might get overwhelmed at seeing new terms introduced and other stuff like that. I know that Kiefmaster once rejected this idea before (<a href="Archive_9.html#Simplified_English_Touhouwiki" title="Talk:Touhou Wiki/Archive 9">see previous discussion here</a>), but if using "simple English" is that big of a deal (and I see that it has been a very big deal in recent days), then this might be a good cause to actually consider it.--<a href="../User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">としあき</a> 19:07, 30 April 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>After reading the thread that you mentioned, I do agree with Kiefmaster in that it would be a waste of manpower to create a separate Simple English version. This effort could be better used to improve the comprehension of the original English wiki. If you do not understand something in my opening statement, please tell me so.--<a href="../User_Choja.html" title="User:Choja">Choja</a> 19:24, 30 April 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Are you saying that the entire wiki should be turned into "simple English," then? If so, I think it should be done separately because there is a lot of value in having more comprehensive and accurate information, even if it may not be as "accessible," especially with something like Touhou which is deeply related to things in Japanese culture, mythology, and religion. If you are supposing that everything should be in "simple English," I think it is still important to preserve a "regular version."--<a href="../User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">としあき</a> 19:39, 30 April 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>No, I am saying to move the comprehensive details into separate pages so that the main page is not cluttered with things.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>For example, Youmu has the term ghost and that term can have a link to "yuurei". The reader will have an understanding of "ghost" and if they click the term, they are led to a page for "yuurei" and this page will tell them that a yuurei is a type of ghost, but has distinct features different from what the reader would assume a normal ghost to have. This is a logical transition from ghost to yuurei, the familiar into the unknown. The reader learns more about the kind of ghost that Youmu is, even if she is half of one, but only if the reader wants to know this. They do not have to be slapped with parentheses (ghost (yuurei)) or have gigantic translation notes everywhere to tell the reader this, they can either click the link to learn more or they can just continue to skim the information quickly for what they do want. It shows that the wiki has details on these terms, but does not shove them in the reader's face if they don't want to know about it.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Also, I assume this is an English wiki, yet the titles for characters are still in Japanese with English infoboxes. What's the point of that?--<a href="../User_Choja.html" title="User:Choja">Choja</a> 20:08, 30 April 2012 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Well, not to speak of the example you gave, but on a more general principle, it may be good to have "simpler versions of pages," but I also think that it is still valuable to have versions of the pages where the comprehensive details are not separate. Leading newcomers in gently is, of course, a good thing, but I think it is also important to also have more comprehensive versions so that it can serve as a good reference to people who are not newcomers as well. (I have no idea about the titles).--<a href="../User_Tosiaki.html" title="User:Tosiaki">としあき</a> 20:28, 30 April 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Alright I can certainly address the overload of information by using what I developed @ <a href="../User_Nazeo/Color_Codes/Woosleyism_Translation.html?title=User:Nazeo/Color_Codes/Woosleyism_Translation&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Nazeo/Color Codes/Woosleyism Translation (page does not exist)">Woosleyism Translations</a> &amp; <a href="../User_Nazeo/Color_Codes/Blind_Cirno_Translation.html?title=User:Nazeo/Color_Codes/Blind_Cirno_Translation&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Nazeo/Color Codes/Blind Cirno Translation (page does not exist)">Blind Cirno Translations</a>.
</p><p>Both end this impasse and address the things I found rather important.
</p>
<ul><li>The information can be accessed from our wiki instead of looking all over the place</li>
<li>This will be a library not just limited to Character Titles. Terms will be included as well. Oh, and let's touch on that...</li>
<li>We provide the true translation and the common English one so Users can switch back and forth to see what that stuff is so it doesn't end up the Users how want info at a glance to loom up "Yūrei" and find out it just means "Ghost". Conversely, the User who wants to know what that word really is doesn't have to be annoyed that the translation has been "smudged"</li>
<li>The pages can be used by either User type as the information caters to their interests (Having relevant interests helps)</li>
<li>Goes without saying, but this will settle any future disputes on the regards of having a "Literal translation" or "Easily Understood Translation"</li></ul>
<p>Where these would be linked is another discussion,(I suggest a section on the <a href="../User_Nazeo/Color_Codes.html?title=User:Nazeo/Color_Codes&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Nazeo/Color Codes (page does not exist)">CharBox</a> and a subpage of <a href="../Characters/Titles.html" title="Characters/Titles">Characters/Titles</a>)

</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I think, when translating, a couple of question should be asked:
<dl><dd>What is to original text (sentence, word, word group etc.) actually means in the context of the whole text?</dd>
<dd>How can this be translated to make it both understandable and close to its meaning?</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>I think translations shouldn't be literal all the time. As long as other words can be found to give it the same meaning.</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>And seriously, I went downstairs to take a snack which I had something good to comment here, am I forgetting it as I wanted to type it.. O well. ☢ <a href="../User_Quwanti.html" title="User:Quwanti">Quwanti</a> 23:33, 30 April 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>You're not reading what I'm saying.
</p><p>Please stop making it more complicated than it has to be. "Woosleyism Translations &amp; Blind Cirno Translations" makes it sound like the wiki has no grasp on which translation is correct so they put both of them in "just to cover their bases". I don't think any reader would take terms like those seriously anyways.
</p><p>The wiki is supposed to be a quick resource website that also contains detailed explanations IF the reader wants to delve into such matters. Are you suggesting that readers are braindead?--<a href="../User_Choja.html" title="User:Choja">Choja</a> 01:19, 1 May 2012 (UTC)
</p><p>@Quwanti Ah, so you're part of the Woosleyism camp! That's fine, I just don't wanna discriminate on both groups because saying one translation is better than another is a slippery slope argument as both are just as correct in their one ways. Equal representation for both sides is best.
</p><p>@Choja Not at all, I think our users are quite able to derive information. My hang up is that this Wiki may be the only place they get their information. So we should be able to at least give them an option to pick which they want. As for the terms, they were meant to be playful and to be humorous, but I see you more of the serious crowd. In that case, the terms "Literal Translation" &amp; "English Derivative" would be in place of Woosleyism and Blind Cirno. As for the "not taking us seriously part" I see no harm
in having both, we make it their choice to pick and people will see that we cater to both instead of picking just one. If you don't like one version of the translation, that's fine, you have the other to look to. 
</p><p>I think it's fair anyway...

<dl><dd>It's difficult for readers to trust the wiki if the wiki is not going to uphold itself to the highest standard for translation purposes, especially if it's the only source of information for certain users like you suggest. Making it harder to understand the system of the wiki by using terms that normal users would not identify with easily will not help the case at all.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Despite this, I was gravely mistaken by the conditions of the character profiles as I actually found them quite satisfactory. I still want to maintain a "simple front, detailed back" policy where the wiki displays its frequented pages with the basics and connects them to details placed in separate pages on the wiki. This makes sure the frequented pages are not cluttered with information that the readers are not currently searching for or cannot recognize without enough in-universe context.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Also, I unfortunately got kicked in the fact by Momiji because I managed to contradict myself by saying that the literal translation in the current Characters/Abilities should be removed when it was practically the same approach I was going for described above.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Anyways, I'm just reaffirming these details and hoping that they become guidelines for future pages. I still made it really complicated though, I need to work on that.--<a href="../User_Choja.html" title="User:Choja">Choja</a> 21:43, 2 May 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I've deleted both of the pages, so that takes care of that.
</p><p>(I'd like to reiterate the the terms were changeable, I just used those because I had no better words at the time without getting excessively wordy and Ibaraki Ibuki was so kind to help me out. But that isn't important now.)

<p>I believe the current format of the title of official games/fangames/CDs/print-works in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_section" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lead section">lead section</a> are having a problem, and therefore I strongly propose to change the format to Wikipedia's style: <i><b>Full title in Romaji (if non-Latin script)</b></i> (Full title in the original language, <i>lit. English translation of the title</i>), e.g. <i><b>Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil.</b></i> (東方紅魔郷 ～ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil., <i>lit. Eastern Lands of the Scarlet Devil</i>). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil">Wikipedia link to EoSD</a>. The reason of the proposal: First of all, the current official games' title are all written as - <b>Title in Japanese</b> (<i>Romaji</i>, "translation"), which I believe isn't a good style because this is an English wiki; <b>non-Latin scripts shouldn't be in the front</b>. Secondly, from what I've observed, almost all of the official/unofficial music albums titles and fangames titles are written in <i><b>English translation</b></i> (original title, <i>romaji</i>) format, and I think this also is not a sensible format to be applied. Because translations done by some random editors that may or may not be relevant (not just the accuracy of the wording, but inconsistency problems too)  are taking precedence over the always relevant original title. (in Wikipedia, most of the pages that apply translation first are pages of works that have been translated by a professional and given an official English title by them). I'm aware that I'm making a quite of challenge here because it is suggesting to change almost all of the existing pages, but even so I still feel this move (or else at least deciding the standardization of the format) is needed and should be considered.--<a href="../User_Doncot.html" title="User:Doncot">Doncot</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Doncot.html" title="User talk:Doncot">talk</a>) 18:11, 10 August 2012 (EDT)

<p>Here are a few ideas I thought of to possibly improve our music wiki pages:
</p><p>1. Creating categories and categorizing the lyrics by character name and game. This will enable us to, for example, search for every song derived from Fujiwara no Mokou or even, using <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Category_intersection">category intersection tools</a>, every English song derived from Reimu's theme songs. Currently, this wiki doesn't have many lyrics categories. I could do this by learning how to use <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AWB">AWB</a>, and then copying the lists from the <a href="../Doujin_music.html" title="Doujin music">Doujin music</a> page into categories for the songs as was suggested in IRC. As a note, if this idea is agreed upon, the implementer's username will need to be listed on <a href="../Touhou_Wiki_AutoWikiBrowser/CheckPage.html" title="Touhou Wiki:AutoWikiBrowser/CheckPage">Touhou Wiki:AutoWikiBrowser/CheckPage</a>.
</p><p>2. If possible and in our best interests, perhaps we can ask to borrow lyrics content from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://unk0495.blog33.fc2.com/">http://unk0495.blog33.fc2.com/</a> and give credit to the source of the content. Though this isn't something I can do because I can't speak Japanese. --<a href="../User_Sbluen.html" title="User:Sbluen">Sbluen</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Sbluen.html" title="User talk:Sbluen">talk</a>) 00:15, 5 September 2012 (EDT)
</p><p>Here are some more details.
To implement idea #1, I'm planning the following changes:
</p><p><b>Automated changes</b>
</p>
<ul><li>For each lyrics page that exists:</li></ul>
<p><s>**Add the characters to the template based on who's theme the original song name belongs to.</s> Can probably be done through templates with the original song only.
</p>
<ul><li><ul><li><s>Add the song's album name</s> (I didn't realize that this was already done. However, it might be useful to had a textual link as will. That will be a template change task.)</li>
<li>As for the character and staff categorization, see below.</li></ul></li>
<li>For each circle and group:
<ul><li>Create a category with the text "Main Page: [[&lt;main page title&gt;]]</li>
<li>Add the circle and group's article to the category with wikitext in this format: [[Category:Greater Manchester| ]]</li></ul></li>
<li>For each original song:
<ul><li><s>Create song article</s> not needed</li>
<li>Create song category</li>
<li>Link to every lyrics page that exists from <a href="../List_by_Song.html" title="List by Song">List by Song</a> list.</li>
<li><s>Add link to album for every arrangement that has a known album</s> (already taken care of)</li></ul></li></ul>
<p><b>Changes to <a href="../Template_Lyrics.html" title="Template:Lyrics">Template:Lyrics</a></b>
</p>
<ul><li>Fields for up to <s>3 characters</s> 5 songs</li>
<li>Lyrics source reference</li>
<li>Automatic categorization for albums and original songs
<ul><li><s>As for character categorization, that will have to be done through Google. I don't like the idea of having extra pages just to categorize and link to categories for the original songs. Also, I don't think this wiki should primarily focus a lot of effort on becoming a database of song characters, comiket numbers, and song style categories.</s> See revised opinion below.</li>
<li>Automatic original song categorization
<ul><li>As for character categorization, that will have to be done through Google. To help with that, we can take the text out of the tooltip and put it into plain, searchable text. Perhaps we can have a feature in which that text may go into the tooltip instead, based on user preferences. The original song parameter is already part of the lyrics pages, so we might as well keep using it and take advantage of it.</li></ul></li>
<li>Comiket numbers, and song style categories still aren't very useful as a part of the lyrics pages.</li>
<li>As for staff categorization, we can't do it until proper category redirects are implemented. We would need to redirect between the different  romanizations.</li></ul></li>
<li><s>Increase number of displayed albums to 7</s> (done)</li>
<li>Add text links below song album picture so that it's understood that the picture refers to the album and not to the song.</li></ul>
<p>(Note: As discussed in IRC, these template changes will have to wait until we can install MediaWiki 1.20 so that we can simplify the process with Lua scripts)
</p><p>Of course this will only work once we make sure that our lyrics pages are uniformly formatted.
</p><p>As for idea #2, the process seems to have already started for some of the songs in <a href="../TOHO_EUROBEAT_VOL-3.html" title="TOHO EUROBEAT VOL.2">TOHO_EUROBEAT_VOL.2</a>. However, it might have been best to ask for permission from the source. It might still be a good idea to link and credit the reference for those lyrics. --<a href="../User_Sbluen.html" title="User:Sbluen">Sbluen</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Sbluen.html" title="User talk:Sbluen">talk</a>) 13:16, 13 September 2012 (EDT)
</p>
<dl><dd>While searching by characters does sound convenient, I feel that it's rather more logical to search by the original song names. Also, I'm sure that most songs will be fine with three character fields, but it's quite common for certain denpa <s>sounds</s> songs to have more than four references like <a href="../Lyrics__%e3%81%93%e3%81%ae%e5%90%8c%e4%ba%ba%e3%82%b4%e3%83%ad%ef%bc%81%e6%9c%89%e6%98%8e%e3%81%8b%e3%82%89%e5%87%ba%e3%81%a6%e8%a1%8c%e3%81%91%ef%bc%81.html" title="Lyrics: この同人ゴロ！有明から出て行け！">this</a> (and <a href="../Unbeatable_Accomplice.html" title="Unbeatable Accomplice">track 8 of this album</a> has even <i>15</i> references, though it's vocal less).  BTW I've encountered another problem while ago with the lyrics template: <a href="../Lyrics__%e3%83%81%e3%83%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%ab%e3%83%81%e3%83%ab%e3%83%8e.html" title="Lyrics: チルミルチルノ">Lyrics: チルミルチルノ</a> is included in seven albums, but the template can only show five, maybe we need to expand it? --<a href="../User_Doncot.html" title="User:Doncot">Doncot</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Doncot.html" title="User talk:Doncot">talk</a>) 16:28, 13 September 2012 (EDT)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Thanks for the idea. I've added it as part of the list of automated changes.

<p>After further analysis of the features we have, the work that has already been done, and the page <a href="../MediaWiki_SongSource.html" title="MediaWiki:SongSource.js">MediaWiki:SongSource.js</a>, I've narrowed the list of useful changes to the following:
</p><p><b>Automated changes</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Create categories for groups and circles where they don't exist</li>
<li>Create categories for albums and original songs</li>
<li>Check categories for groups, circles, and albums</li></ul>
<p><b>Changes to <a href="../Template_Lyrics.html" title="Template:Lyrics">Template:Lyrics</a></b>
</p>
<ul><li>Automatic parsing of an unlimited number of songs to link and display the original song title, character/stage, and game/original CD
<ul><li>Probably link the original song title to the category for it</li></ul></li>
<li>Lyrics source reference</li>
<li>Automatic categorization for album, groups, and circles</li>
<li>Add text links below album picture so that it's understood that the picture refers to the album and not to the song.</li>
<li>Add and parse staff categorization whenever category redirects are possible in wiki software</li>
<li>Template parameter to describe English lyrics that are not a translation, but a different version of the song</li></ul>
<p><b>Other manual changes</b>
</p>

<p>Of course, these changes still will have to wait for Wikimedia 1.20.

<dl><dd>Hm... I'm not sure if I understand how the "automatic categorization for albums" should work.</dd>
<dd>If it's about adding the page to category named after the album, then it's easy to do (actually have it done already <a href="../User_DennouNeko/Lyrics.html" title="User:DennouNeko/Lyrics">in here</a>).</dd>
<dd>If the page should be put to categories that the albums belong to, then it can be done by either parsing the album article to find its categories or there should be some page containing a kind of album-categories index. There are few things to keep in mind when doing that, but it's possible and relatively easy to parse another article.</dd>
<dd>Not sure about "parsing of unlimited number of songs" and "staff categorization" too...</dd>

<p>Actually, it was never relevant to begin with, since Ten Desires had already been released for an entire year before the aesthetic changes were made.
But now it's been almost four months since the release of the demo for Hopeless Masquerade. Shouldn't the frontpage have a design that is up-to-date with what is new? And if that's not very feasible, wouldn't a conservative, generic layout be better in that regard? --<a href="../../indexa41f-2.php?title=User:Zehnfragezeichen&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Zehnfragezeichen (page does not exist)">Zehnfragezeichen</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Zehnfragezeichen" title="User talk:Zehnfragezeichen">talk</a>) 00:11, 29 March 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I am superficially aware of the apparent drama regarding the fairies. And I don't really care to learn any details about it. I don't care who drew them, and if it was you who drew them then I hope you don't take offense to my opinions. The fact of the matter is that they were old-hat when they were added, and they cause a bit of oddities at certain window sizes. There's some other incongruities that are present, mostly with the divs. I'll try playing around with some options to find something that will mesh nicely. --<a href="../../indexa41f-2.php?title=User:Zehnfragezeichen&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Zehnfragezeichen (page does not exist)">Zehnfragezeichen</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Zehnfragezeichen" title="User talk:Zehnfragezeichen">talk</a>) 01:21, 29 March 2013 (UTC)

<dd>This seems like a cool idea actually! I think a new batch of characters with the full release of Hopeless Masquerade would be neat, perhaps with whatever new character is unveiled for the game, assuming there will be one.

<dl><dd>Well, it is an expansion, but it doesn't actually require SWR to be playable - it can act as independent game. • <a href="../User_DennouNeko.html" title="User:DennouNeko">DennouNeko</a>–[<div style="display:inline-block;font-size:80%;vertical-align:middle;line-height:1.2em;"><a href="../User_talk_DennouNeko.html" title="User talk:DennouNeko">talk</a><br><a href="../Special_Contributions/DennouNeko.html" title="Special:Contributions/DennouNeko">contribs</a></div> 16:28, 19 August 2013 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry, but treating 12.3 as a separate game is like treating a full version as a separate game from its trial, <i>especially</i> if you want to bring the (extremely limited) standalone portion into it. <a href="../User_Despatche.html?title=User:Despatche&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Despatche (page does not exist)">Despatche</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Despatche.html" title="User talk:Despatche">talk</a>) 12:59, 20 August 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Please don't compare this to trial version. Trial and a full version share exactly same title, and trial is more or less the same game without full functionality. In case of SWR and Hisoutensoku you get two separate games, where the latter just gains extra functionality when they are combined. • <a href="../User_DennouNeko.html" title="User:DennouNeko">DennouNeko</a>–[<div style="display:inline-block;font-size:80%;vertical-align:middle;line-height:1.2em;"><a href="../User_talk_DennouNeko.html" title="User talk:DennouNeko">talk</a><br><a href="../Special_Contributions/DennouNeko.html" title="Special:Contributions/DennouNeko">contribs</a></div> 13:52, 20 August 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd>You seem to agree with what I wrote, so you also agree that those are two separate games. Unless you didn't read it carefully enough.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Server_Hardware_Fun">Server Hardware Fun</span></h2>
<p>So Linode has been doing a bunch of hardware upgrades to their datacenters, along with free RAM increases.  So we queued up the site last night for migration to the new server hardware.  Things were working okay until earlier today when stuff started falling apart.  Turns out we got migrated onto a server that probably had bad hardware.  So Linode moved everything to a different server and we spent most of the day today piecing the software stack back together.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Manual_of_Style">Manual of Style</span></h2>
<p>I've been going through a bunch of names today, formatting all of them to conform to a common <a href="../Manual_of_Style" class="mw-redirect" title="Manual of Style">Manual of Style</a> for consistency. Namely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:MOS" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:WP:MOS">Wikipedia's</a>.
Since there are differences in opinion though, I suppose now's the time to clear up exactly how we should do things. To my knowledge, this Wiki does not have a well-defined Manual of Style. Therefore, I propose that we default to Wikipedia's Manual of Style for the sake of simplicity and similarity. Any thoughts? <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User talk:Kiefmaster99">talk</a>) 23:28, 30 May 2013 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>No objections. I think one important rule in this, is "Use "sentence case", not "title case"; that is, the initial letter of a title is capitalized (except in rare cases, such as eBay), but otherwise, capital letters are used only where they would be used in a normal sentence (Funding of UNESCO projects, not Funding of UNESCO Projects).". We tend to capitalize every single word in a page's title, or most headers, which I think is rather annoying and unnecessary. ☢ <a href="../User_Quwanti.html" title="User:Quwanti">Quwanti</a> 00:17, 31 May 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>That depends on where the rule is being applied. "Title case" will be applied to proper nouns, such as the names of people, spell cards, and song names. <s>The title case rule does not affect article titles nor section headings.</s> The title case rule would have to be clarified. Wikipedia uses sentence case for their articles and section headings, wheras that rule is not consistently followed here. We could switch to Wikipedia in that case, though it would lead to rather sweeping changes across the wiki. Alternately we could have exceptions to the rule. <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User talk:Kiefmaster99">talk</a>) 00:27, 31 May 2013 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>For now, I just want to affirm  the following:
<dl><dd>1. All proper nouns will be in title case. In particular, song names and spell card names.
<dl><dd>1a. Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Capital_letters#Composition_titles" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters">Wikipedia's MOS</a>. In particular, capitalize prepositions with at least five letters, and if involved with a phrasal verb (e.g. Cross-Up). Treat each word in a hyphenated term as if it were an individual word. (e.g. Suppression "Super-Ego")</dd>
<dd>1b. Keep trailing Japanese honorifics and such sentence case. (e.g. Impossible Request "Seamless Ceiling of Kinkaku-ji"; the last 'word' so to speak is "Kinkaku-ji").</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>This is so I can at least get rid of inconsistency among spell card names and song titles which seem to adhere to multiple rules at the same time. <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User talk:Kiefmaster99">talk</a>) 04:10, 31 May 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>You really bugged me with that hyphen thing.  Do you really think that hyphenated words such as "ink-black" and "love-coloured" should have both words capitalized?  If I remember correctly, there was a slight edit war a long time ago over "Love-coloured Master Spark".  At the very least, you don't capitalize adjectives that are essential to the whole word's meaning ("black" in "ink-black").  Would you capitalize "important" in "non-important"? <a href="../User_Code_Slasher.html" title="User:Code Slasher">Code Slasher</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Code_Slasher.html" title="User talk:Code Slasher">talk</a>) 04:21, 31 May 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Here's the problem. The list before was following multiple rules at the same time. While we had stuff like "Love-coloured" and "Ink-black", we also had "Super-ego" and "Anti-Youkai" (modifier + noun), "Roc-killing" and "Paparazzi-Repelling" (noun + verb into an adjective), and for your example, "Love-coloured" and "Non-Directional" (adjective). This was before I made sweeping changes across the lists. There was simply <i>no</i> common standard being followed, and the majority seemed to obey the 'capitalize both' rule anyhow.</dd>
<dd>In the end, it depends on what Manual of Style we want to follow. Gregg's handles it differently than Chicago's does. Whether "Love-coloured" becomes capitalized or not depends entirely on that. If I had to type "non-important" as a title on Wikipedia, yes, I would have to use "Non-Important". Since I can't see why any one MOS is any better than the others as it's on the point of being arbitrary, it makes most sense to simply default to Wikipedia's (which we use for most other things) unless there are good reasons to follow the other ones. <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User talk:Kiefmaster99">talk</a>) 04:45, 31 May 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Translation_Style_Guide">Translation Style Guide</span></h2>
<p>Is there a standardized guide to what we want translations to look like?  A lot of the translations on Touhouwiki are so literal that you can tell that they were originally written in Japanese and could probably backtranslate them literally word for word.  Conversely, other  translations attempt to convey the meaning in text that actually looks like it was written by an English speaker, and make liberal changes to what was actually said.  Is there a guide or style manual I'm missing, or have people just been winging it? <a href="../User_AbyssNova" title="User:AbyssNova">AbyssNova</a> (<a href="../User_talk_AbyssNova" title="User talk:AbyssNova">talk</a>) 20:06, 1 June 2013 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>To my knowledge, there isn't exactly any translation guideline on how literal/liberal to make the translations. It was kind of assumed that it would be up to the individual discretion of editors who think they know what they're doing (so yes, the latter). In the past, the different style of translators, plus limited coordination, led to inconsistencies in names and such. Recently, one editor did join and heavily increased the literalness of the translations. On the other hand, I know there are some translators who have voiced their opinion on not wanting to go too far off into the deep end (see <a href="../Talk_Hopeless_Masquerade/Characters.html#Reimu.27s_Title" title="Talk:Hopeless Masquerade/Characters">here</a>). Still, it's a wiki, so it's not very surprising to see stuff being done differently.</dd>
<dd>Our translations should be translated in so far as it is possible to make our text sound natural, with some liberties if necessary. On the other hand, the nature of Touhou itself, with many references to Japanese elements, not to mention ZUN's wordplay, acts as a counterweight.</dd>
<dd>It is possible to establish a more solid guideline here for translators in the future. Some input would be nice. <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User talk:Kiefmaster99">talk</a>) 23:31, 1 June 2013 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think it would help to establish some benchmark examples to help guide translators into favouring literalness or liberalness in certain scenarios. I have selected some names which I believe test the boundary between them:
<dl><dd>火水木金土符「賢者の石」
<dl><dd>Fire Water Wood Metal Earth Sign "Philosopher's Stone" (as opposed to Five Elements; association with the days of the week)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>「百万鬼夜行」
<dl><dd>"Night Parade of One Million Demons" (as opposed to "Pandemonium")</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>波符「赤眼催眠(マインドシェイカー)」
<dl><dd>Wave Sign "Red-Eyed Hypnosis (Mind Shaker)" (as opposed to "Mind Shaker")</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>水符「夏のペットボトルロケット」
<dl><dd>Water Sign "Summer Water Bottle Rocket" (as opposed to PET Bottle)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>鬼符「怪力乱神」
<dl><dd>Oni Sign "Anomalies, Strength, Disorder, and Spirits" (as opposed to "Supernatural Phenomena")</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>傘符「一本足ピッチャー返し」
<dl><dd>Umbrella Sign "One-Legged Return Hit" (as opposed to Pitcher)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>鱗符「逆鱗の荒波」
<dl><dd>Scale Sign "Raging Waves of the Reversed Scale" (as opposed to Imperial Wrath)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>牙符「月下の犬歯」
<dl><dd>Fang Sign "Canine Teeth Under the Moon" (as opposed to 'in the Moonlight')</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>八百万の代弁者

<dd>九天の滝
<dl><dd>Waterfall of Nine Heavens (as opposed to "Waterfall of the Heavens")</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>First, by no means do the current translations suggest they are 'right'. Nor are they completely representative of everything Touhou (my knowledge of scripts are lacking compared to spell cards). But for some of the translations, it depends on how important it is to convey the literalness. For example, in Nitori's case, ペットボトル (PET Bottle) is an uncommon kind-of-techical term found in some manuals on how to make a 2L water bottle rocket, so water bottle is favoured. On the other hand, 逆鱗 (Reversed Scale), while part of a saying, is interpreted literally to fit in with Scale Sign. <a href="../User_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User:Kiefmaster99">- Kiefmaster99</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Kiefmaster99.html" title="User talk:Kiefmaster99">talk</a>) 15:28, 2 June 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Not to be a nitpicking whiner (which I am) but as for the example's you've listed -
<dl><dd>怪力乱神 is a phrase that means "supernatural phenomena" and a kanji-by-kanji translation confuses more than it illuminates.</dd>
<dd>I think it's more important to convey the intended meaning "imperial wrath" than retain ZUN's little pun.  Puns break when you translate them.  Retaining them is usually more trouble than its worth.</dd>
<dd>Whenever the "eight million" are referred to, I think either it should simply be translated "eight million gods" or a TL note added (even thought that would get old fast) as the phrase alone loses all of its meaning when translated into English unless the reader happens to be familiar with Shinto (which would not be surprising for a Touhou Project fan, but still).</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>The purpose of translation is to convey the meaning of what is being said.  It shouldn't require additional expertise on the part of the reader to interpret it.  I would suggest that communication of meaning be the highest priority, with literalism and naturalism both taking a back seat.  At times this may require retention of tone.  During the Sack of Mayohiga, "let's go loot stuff" conveys Reimu's attitude better than "I must find lightweight familiar everyday necessities" despite the fact that the literal meaning has been butchered.  If there's some sort of notable wordplay involved I suggest it simply be stuffed into a TL note and called a day. <a href="../User_AbyssNova" title="User:AbyssNova">AbyssNova</a> (<a href="../User_talk_AbyssNova" title="User talk:AbyssNova">talk</a>) 18:45, 2 June 2013 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, on second thought here, the example I used doesn't illustrate the point I was trying to make at all, since it would seem to prize naturalism over communication.  Something like, "let's go find some of that silverware" would probably be a better balance. Eeh, what a mess. 19:03, 2 June 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Character_Battle">Character Battle</span></h2>
<p>GameFAQS recently started another one of its character battles, and unlike in previous years, it only takes around 15,000 votes to win a match (or around 7,000 for 2nd place), so rallying could have a significant effect.  Reimu, Marisa, and Cirno all made it into the bracket, and I was wondering if it would be possible to put up a link to the voting page on the wiki's main page during their matches.  Matches are only 12 hours long, so the link wouldn't have to be up there for long.  By the way, Reimu's match is in 4 days, and Marisa's would probably the easiest to affect because Reimu and Cirno have Final Fantasy 7 characters in their matches, while Marisa only has a Final Fantasy 9 character.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Initialisms_and_the_titles">Initialisms and the titles</span></h2>
<p>I don't really know where to put these kinds of things so I'm dumping it all here I guess.
</p><p>The initialisms need to go because they're not helpful or informative in the slightest. Again, do we really need to know that Super Mario Bros. is also known as Mario Bros. (not to be confused with the game or the characters), Mario (not to be confused with the series or the character), SMB (not to be confused with everything "SMB" stands for), and so on? No, the fact that there's tons of ambiguous detail with the Mario example doesn't really make a different; I'm just pulling this out into a principle and showing why it doesn't work.
</p><p>We absolutely need to start using the main titles as the default, not the subtitles... anything else is simply misleading. There's no better proof than the common belief that there's some "Japanese title" and some "English title" for every game. There's only a main title and a subtitle; one happens to be written with kanji, while the other happens to be written with Latin and is generally made up of English words... which means nothing, except when talking about the merit of this style. Obviously, we need to make an exception for things like Double Spoiler and Yousei Daisensou, but fortunately ZUN did the work for us and just made those the main title; he clearly understands this problem too, and that's simply on the "Japanese" side of things.
</p><p>I get the feeling these two are related; people use the subtitles because they're "English", because they can initialize those... "how do you initialize kanji" (it's actually very easy...)? It is imperative that this, a fairly serious English wiki on a Japanese series made by and for English-speaking fans (never mind the various other languages this project supports), respects what is right as far as what is physically possible, not as far as what is "comfortable"... you adhere to a flawed status quo, and it stays flawed forever. That's the problem Wikipedia has, and they don't seem to get that... I'm hoping you guys will understand this better, as you seem to take this stuff a bit more seriously (if not necessarily these two topics here).
</p><p>...Aside from all of this, "the" needs to be respected; it is completely nonsensical to drop it or move it to the end "just because", as it defeats the whole point of even using the thing.

Even without it readers can guess what number of spellcard in a battle something is by looking at the difficulties and figuring it out themselves, but the headers will make the information readily available to them.

<dd>As to Code Slasher's point, we certainly don't preserve the English spellings that ZUN gives for some of the characters; we use official Hepburn romanization in all cases. In addition, as it is, in fact, English, the correct prefix would be "necro". The word can be spelled either "fantasia" or "phantasia", but I'm going to go off on a limb here and assume that we initially used "fantasia" because it is also the title of the Disney movie. Also, it looks like "fantasia" is the more common spelling in general.

<p>Japanese names are one thing (and a thing that really needs to change), but applying something similar to foreign or foreign-based words is crossing a very clear line. In general, continuing to use an inaccurate spelling because "it's always been used" is simply silly; not even the Gundam community (generally) does this, once something gets released. You can say "consistency" all you want, yet adhering to prescribed terms is way more consistent than overriding one term for the sake of inaccurate "consistency"; there's even a term in English for this, being "hypercorrection".

<h2><span id='"Fandom"_sections_on_Character_pages'></span><span class="mw-headline" id=".22Fandom.22_sections_on_Character_pages">"Fandom" sections on Character pages</span></h2>
<p>It was recently brought to my attention how the "Fandom" section on the Character pages is a little out-of-place and potentially irrelevant, given how pretty much all the other information is more canonical. I agree that it could probably stand to be taken out, or at least moved to a separate, catch-all "Fandom" page. I realize it can be important/interesting to track trends in how characters are perceived over time, but such subjective information should be elsewhere. <a href="../User_NForza.html" title="User:NForza">NForza</a> (<a href="../User_talk_NForza" title="User talk:NForza">talk</a>) 14:30, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I don't have a straight answer on that myself.  Fandom stuff will still creep back into a given article, and I think we might've discussed putting it in a subpage at some point in the past.  If anything, having it on the main article will force a shortlisting of that information, instead of dumping everything and anything into a subpage.  <a href="../User_Mamizou.html?title=User:Mamizou&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Mamizou (page does not exist)">Mamizou</a> (<a href="../../indexc03b-2.php?title=User_talk:Mamizou&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Mamizou (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:35, 15 March 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Given we have a huge catalog of fan material, I feel it makes more sense to have some article describing how various characters are portrayed in fan works as opposed to removing the fandom section altogether. After a lot of deliberation on the issue, I wouldn't be against having a separate fandom page (which could be part of a recently hatched plot of mine to simplify the character article guidelines). <a href="../User_IbarakiIbuki.html" title="User:IbarakiIbuki">Ibaraki Ibuki</a> (<a href="../User_talk_IbarakiIbuki.html" title="User talk:IbarakiIbuki">talk</a>) 05:10, 16 March 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>A catalog of fan material is still more factual (since you're saying "this stuff exists") than the descriptions of portrayals.

<p>I didn't really have a problem with Fandom subsections before the Tosiaki mess when he muddled what was originally succinct, mostly relevant information with cruft from Nico's encyclopedia, thus making it confusing when we tried to revert back. As far as I know we just gave up on restoring them. Not that I really care about our naysayers, but with concerns I've previously seen about "Fandom creep" on pages which should be centered on canon, I think we would be better off throwing it elsewhere.<br>
Since it would now be separate from character pages I think we <i>should</i> just go right ahead and cover all that we can since we wouldn't have to limit ourselves anymore. Of course we should retain some standards for inclusion, but to merge all topics together, I suggest creating Fandom, under which we would have Fandom/Undefined Fantastic Object for a list of characters and their portrayals and memes, and so forth for other games. *Maybe* go the extra step by listing good or noteworthy doujins pertaining to that group or character, kind of like what the old <a href="../List_by_Song.html" title="List by Song">List by Song</a> pages were like, though I don't know if anyone wants to go for that. But anyway, as another example of what could be done with Fandom, we could move the <a href="../Fan-made_characters.html" title="Fan-made characters">Fan-made characters</a> pages there. There's a bunch more stuff at <a href="../Random_Things.html" title="Random Things">Random Things</a> that would also fit. <a href="../User_UTW.html" title="User:UTW">UTW</a> 08:51, 17 March 2014 (UTC)

</p><p>Recently, I've been told by a few more experienced users that I should just click on the Upload File button, then switch the "pool" on the URL to a slick "en" and reload, then upload and categorize normally from there. But if so, then what's the point of the Pool anyway? I might be inexperienced in this wiki, and it's true that I don't know the Pool's history at all (or even why it was initially established), but what's the point of it? If using the Pool is inevitable, then isn't there a way to link it more strongly to the actual en.touhouwiki (and other affiliated touhouwikis) dominion?

<p><font face="Garamond"><font size="3">Hi guys. So, as you can see in a few fangame pages I edited (<a href="../Ojou-sama_no_DokiDoki_Daisakusen_-Norowareta_Aka_no_Yakata-/Items.html" title="Ojou-sama no DokiDoki Daisakusen -Norowareta Aka no Yakata-/Items">this one</a> at the end, and <a href="../Ojou-sama_no_DokiDoki_Daisakusen_-Norowareta_Aka_no_Yakata-/Walkthrough.html#Room-by-room_Walkthrough" title="Ojou-sama no DokiDoki Daisakusen -Norowareta Aka no Yakata-/Walkthrough">this one</a> at the marked spot), I recently had the idea of "abusing" the ref commands to make it easier to make observations in tables without an extra column just for that; the auto-linking also makes it a lot easier to reference back and forth between said observation and its corresponding main text. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="Garamond"><font size="3">I say "abusing" because I think that's not how you're supposed to use the ref command, and from what little I know about Wikipedia policies, all pages are supposed to have tons of references as sources whenever an affirmation is made as fact and blah blah... and I know that does apply all too well to larger pages, such as character pages (like, if someone writes down a "canon fact", a source will be needed), but... to some pages, such as fangame gameplay pages, this doesn't apply <i>at all</i>! 
</font></font></p><p><font face="Garamond"><font size="3">The reason for that is that these are mostly self-taught (by either observation, search or analysis) tips, walkthroughs, item listings, etc. Since the source is the very writer, the writer is the source, though this also makes what's written questionable through argumentation in talk pages... or just through random offensive comments when editing as if those edits were unquestionable, which is bad practice, but does happen kind of often.
</font></font></p><p><font face="Garamond"><font size="3"><br>
My point is: even knowing all the policies and such, I still found good reason to use these commands in fangame pages. A <i>suggestion</i> I want to make from there is that either this or a similar system is applied to pages such as the ones in <a href="../Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense.html" title="Perfect Memento in Strict Sense">Perfect Memento in Strict Sense</a>, <a href="../Symposium_of_Post-mysticism.html" title="Symposium of Post-mysticism">Symposium of Post-mysticism</a> (which I read and enjoyed recently, by the way!), and, well, Touhou written works in general o.o.
</font></font></p><p><font face="Garamond"><font size="3">The issue is that Touhou written works will occasionally need the ref command for their intended purpose, ossia, so as to directly cite a source. However, the auto-linking system would be VERY very handy in reading and browsing those pages, because ZUN has an habit of making many asterisk observations himself. For me, when I read, an asterisk inbetween always makes me curious, so I immediately go down to check what observation is that, then back up where I was reading: this task is rewarding, since I'm reading it in more or less the same order everything was written, but also very tedious to do manually.
</font></font></p><p><font face="Garamond"><font size="3">I don't know, maybe we could make a template specifically for this, so that it doesn't interfere with source linking? I'm not very fond of Wikipedia's policies anyway - though I understand their point for the most part, this is still a very different ambient... but well, the suggestions stand, so discuss. Swear at me for abusing the holy sacred wiki ref command in pages that didn't need them at all, if you will. o_o</font></font>

<p>This idea relates to game articles. I was wondering if the various sub articles, such as '/Gameplay' and '/Characters', ought to be merged onto their main game article. My main reason for gameplay is that those subs are basically talking about the overall game, which is something that you'd usually find on the main articles with other games on different wikis. With characters, they're too short and all they mostly do is list the characters and state what role they play. An example to having gameplay/characters on the main page can be found on the pages <i><a href="../Super_Marisa_World.html" title="Super Marisa World">Super Marisa World</a></i> and <i><a href="../Magus_in_Mystic_Geometries.html" title="Magus in Mystic Geometries">Magus in Mystic Geometries</a></i>.

<dl><dd>I agree. Currently the pages are just a (short) list, and it seems redundant to have a separate article for such small thing.

The info on each /Gameplay page seems to be mostly repeated anyway.

Having the gameplay info centralised somewhere would make it stand out more and trimmed, so I could start creating that centralised page as a sort of "start off" to see if it's a reasonable approach. <span lang="ja">～</span> <a href="../User_Tony64.html" title="User:Tony64">Tony64</a> <sup>(<a href="../User_talk_Tony64.html" title="User talk:Tony64">Talk</a>/<a href="../Special_Contributions/Tony64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tony64">Con.</a>)</sup> 23:05, 24 August 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

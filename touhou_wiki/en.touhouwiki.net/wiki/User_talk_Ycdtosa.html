<dl><dd>Editing just takes some getting used to, a good way to avoid errors like this recent one is to try and investigate why something is the way it is before editing it. Just checking the lyric page in this case should have explained why it's there, so just keep in mind that things you may think are errors might just be missunderstandings and to ask questions in the irc if your not sure of something. This is especially true for official content. <a href="User_Ycdtosa.html" title="User:Ycdtosa">Ycdtosa</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 11:14, 26 April 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Hi there; I got your message on IRC regarding category issues.  Can you show me which files/articles you're having problems with?  <a href="User_Mamizou.html?title=User:Mamizou&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Mamizou (page does not exist)">Mamizou</a> (<a href="../indexc03b-2.php?title=User_talk:Mamizou&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Mamizou (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 03:10, 14 July 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Here's an example: <a href="Category_ZYTOKINE" title="Category:ZYTOKINE">ZYTOKINE's category page</a> which doesn't list the 2 new albums (<a href="Liquid_Total_Reflection_-THE_BEST_of_ZYTOKINE/CYTOKINE2-" title="Liquid Total Reflection -THE BEST of ZYTOKINE/CYTOKINE2-">1</a>, <a href="THE_OUTSIDE_ANSWER_to_the_Ultimate_Question" title="THE OUTSIDE ANSWER to the Ultimate Question">2</a>) under pages or the album covers (<a href="File_CK-0042P.jpg" title="File:CK-0042P.jpg">1</a>, <a href="File_CK-0043P.jpg" title="File:CK-0043P.jpg">2</a>) under files, the albums and files are all tagged for the category as far as I can tell but don't appear in it for whatever reason. If it was just ZYTOKINE I wouldn't think much of it but literally every group I've updated in the past week has the problem, <a href="Category_5150.html" title="Category:5150">5150</a> doesn't display the <a href="Saturations" title="Saturations">new album</a> or files, <a href="Category_Shinigiwa_Satellite" title="Category:Shinigiwa Satellite">Shinigiwa Satellite</a> doesn't display the <a href="CLOWN_EP" title="CLOWN EP">new album</a> or files, <a href="Category_CROW%27SCLAW.html" title="Category:CROW'SCLAW">CROW'SCLAW</a> doesn't display the <a href="Seven_Wonders_Of_The_Lotus_Land" title="Seven Wonders Of The Lotus Land">new album</a> or files and many more.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>So far the only page I've done to actually find it's way into a category page is <a href="First_Memory/Next_Memory" title="First Memory/Next Memory">First Memory/Next Memory</a>, I've added a bunch of Reitaisai 13 albums but that's the only one the show up in the <a href="Category_Reitaisai_13.html" title="Category:Reitaisai 13">Reitaisai 13 category page</a>, it also shows up in the other appropriate categories although not it's album cover of course.

<p>...but other than the circles you mentioned, I don't edit much. I'm primarily focused on adding translations to songs or putting romaji and kanji in the Diao ye zong songs.

<p>We can create category to keep these templates together.  Maybe we should start adding links to vgmdb for example for musicians and to pixiv/danbooru for artists at circle members section? Not necessary and overcomplicated idea, i guess? Anyway, this looks good now, exept we can't see all the aliases at one page, like with music script. --<a href="User_Unknwn.html" title="User:Unknwn">Unknwn</a> (<a href="User_talk_Unknwn.html" title="User talk:Unknwn">talk</a>) 19:36, 4 August 2016 (UTC)

<p>Hello there, you had asked me for reasoning behind my  translation changes? Well I am the public relations for the Touhou Patch Group. The games they have patched have more accuracy with translations. That is why I have changed some of the translations. Plus some of the song names literally have the game title names in them.

<p>If you are interested, you can adapt this to English wiki, I guess it can be pretty useful as reference page/pivot table. <a href="https://ru.touhouwiki.net/wiki/ost/tracklist" class="extiw" title="ru:ost/tracklist">ru:ost/tracklist</a> --<a href="User_Unknwn.html" title="User:Unknwn">Unknwn</a> (<a href="User_talk_Unknwn.html" title="User talk:Unknwn">talk</a>) 00:06, 29 August 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Do you plan to add the Music CDs or just keep it as strictly the game OSTs? I think it would be very useful to have a reference page that listed all of ZUN's compositions, at the very least I know I'd find it useful. I like the idea so I might try and do something with it when I get back to updating the <a href="List_by_Song.html" title="List by Song">List by Song</a> pages if someone else hasn't by then. <a href="User_Ycdtosa.html" title="User:Ycdtosa">Ycdtosa</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 00:28, 31 August 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Yes, there is a lot of work with Music CDs, but I've done ZUN's Seihou music and Strange Works already. They are on separate pages because of structure of ru-wiki but it's easy to join them. Also, you can replace "Russian translation" column with "Romanization". I've tried to add "Cyrillization" column in my table, but it happened to be too huge. <a href="User_Unknwn.html" title="User:Unknwn">Unknwn</a> (<a href="User_talk_Unknwn.html" title="User talk:Unknwn">talk</a>) 01:59, 1 September 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>

<dl><dd>I just went with what the circle (IZNA) said they consider the official title, perhaps I should have wrote official English title on the 東方事変 talk page instead of romanized title. I hadn't considered touhoujihen before asking but looking at their <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.touhoujihen.net/">official page</a> it's the format they use in the copyright text (© 2016 touhoujihen.

<dl><dd>Is this what you used to create the pages from yesterday, that would explain some of the unusual things about a couple of them. I usually check all new pages but if you leave some kind of note in the edit summery letting me know it's an auto generated page I'll go out of my way to double check the info and add anything else I think might be worthwhile. I really think it's important to double check when using secondary sources like another wiki to avoid misinformation being spread and I'd be happy to be the one to do it. It's really cool of you to create something like this since it's such a useful tool, feel free to take any pages you'd like off my worklist, I haven't made any progress on my it since I've been working on a bunch of pages for <a href="%e3%83%a2%e3%82%b8%e3%83%a3%e3%83%b3%e6%a3%92" title="モジャン棒">Moja stick</a>, <a href="%e6%b7%b1%e5%a4%9c%e6%94%be%e9%80%81" title="深夜放送">深夜放送</a>, <a href="%e7%be%a4%e9%9d%92%e3%83%aa%e3%83%9c%e3%83%b3" title="群青リボン">群青リボン</a> and <a href="Pikapika.html" title="Pikapika">pikapika</a> that I plan to spam them all at once around the of this month. <a href="User_Ycdtosa.html" title="User:Ycdtosa">Ycdtosa</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 10:36, 22 January 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Yes, that's what I used to create the pages from yesterday. Would you mind letting me know what unusual things you noticed? Here are the issues I noticed while proofreading them today (or, in some cases, looking at the page history):</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Missing credits. I don't know how to handle this, so credits to staff members other than arrangers, vocalists and lyricists have to be added manually - at least for now. Similarly, the script does not preserve information about what circle an artist is from.</li>
    <li>One of the Yuuhei Satellite albums had "null" where it should say "砕月". This was due to a problem with the script, but it has been fixed. (I had simply neglected IaMP's pre-battle themes.)</li>
    <li>The link to the lyric page of 居るは居ないこの世界＜はこ＞。 on <a href="0%e3%81%a81%e3%81%ae%e5%86%86%e7%92%b0%e8%ab%96%e7%90%86.html" title="0と1の円環論理">0と1の円環論理</a> was originally removed because using the wrong brackets (&lt;&gt;) broke it.</li>
    <li>A couple of mistakes from thwiki.cc were corrected.</li>
    <li>Using {{lang|ja|&lt;name&gt;}} instead of {{&lt;name&gt;}}. This is not a problem with the script - in fact, it doesn't use {{lang|ja|&lt;name&gt;}} for any artist name. This was just a case of me adding lang|ja| when it wasn't necessary.</li>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>I agree that double-checking the info is important, and I appreciate that you're willing to help me with it. I'll make sure to add something like "This page was automatically generated from &lt;link&gt;, and may contain errors and omissions" if I haven't proofread it thoroughly myself. Of course, your proofreading and adding info is always welcome. It's good to hear that you think the script will be useful. <a href="User_Maths__Angelic_Version_.html" title="User:Maths ~Angelic Version~">Maths ~Angelic Version~</a> (<a href="User_talk_Maths__Angelic_Version_" title="User talk:Maths ~Angelic Version~">talk</a>) 00:48, 23 January 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>The first thing I noticed was how the links are presented without the usual formatting ([websiteurl Link]), I wasn't sure if it was a deliberate decision but if there's no reasoning behind it I'd recommend using [websiteurl Link] to be more consistent with the style of other pages. Some of the links used were also inactive since the websites had changed since the thwiki pages were created, I good rule of thumb is to check all the offsite links since it's easy to copy-past the wrong link even when making a page from scratch. You listed everything else I noticed already, you even listed some others I didn't.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>There is a broader issue of people not knowing which artists have hover text, I've been considering using templates for artists even without hover text as a solution since it would also mean adding hover text wouldn't require addition page edits to take effect. I was initially concerned with too many artist name templates having an impact on load times, but at this point most artists listed have hover text without any issue so I'm more strongly consider using the artist name templates for everything.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>When Tsukihime made that album generator there was a mass dump of pages from vgmdb to the Touhou wiki with little to no edits made, allot of these pages are still the same as when Tsukihime posted them. Avoiding situations like that where circles no one is willing to take the time to edit are taken whole-cloth from secondary sources is my only concern. When used responsibly to create pages for circles people are invested in, the tool actually lets us make effective use of larger workforces than out own who contribute to places like thwiki, I think what you are working on could be invaluable in increasing our own productivity. <a href="User_Ycdtosa.html" title="User:Ycdtosa">Ycdtosa</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 11:20, 23 January 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Hi! Nice seeing you again, and thanks for the feedback on the Digital Distribution addition. I'm not aware of any album that appears on iTunes without also appearing on Google Play Music (or vice versa), but it's probably possible. I've changed how <a href="Template_MusicArticle/sandbox.html" title="Template:MusicArticle/sandbox">Template:MusicArticle/sandbox</a> handles links to digital distributions - now it only has one parameter, "digital", which takes one string of pre-formatted links. Is that fine, or is there a better way to do it? I could've added parameters for the other sites instead, but I belive that would've made the code pretty ugly... There's also a separate "tdmd" parameter, so we can link to iTunes and Google Play Music without the template assuming that the album has been published via TDMD. I think that's worth keeping either way. -<a href="User_Maths__Angelic_Version_.html" title="User:Maths ~Angelic Version~">Maths ~Angelic Version~</a> (<a href="User_talk_Maths__Angelic_Version_" title="User talk:Maths ~Angelic Version~">talk</a>) 14:17, 9 April 2019 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I think that way works, the website parameter work more or less the same so it seems like a natural implementation. I also like the idea of the TDMD having a parameter so this seems good to me, thanks for making the change. <a href="User_Ycdtosa.html" title="User:Ycdtosa">Ycdtosa</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 01:49, 13 April 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Glad you like it. I'll make the same changes to the MusicArticle template. -<a href="User_Maths__Angelic_Version_.html" title="User:Maths ~Angelic Version~">Maths ~Angelic Version~</a> (<a href="User_talk_Maths__Angelic_Version_" title="User talk:Maths ~Angelic Version~">talk</a>) 15:17, 17 April 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

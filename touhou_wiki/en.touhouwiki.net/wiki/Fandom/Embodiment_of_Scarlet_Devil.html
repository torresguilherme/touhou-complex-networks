<ul><li><b>EX Rumia</b>: It's broadly rumored among fans that the amulet-ribbon is some kind of "seal", and that taking it off will release her true power. In some doujinshi, when the amulet-ribbon is removed Rumia develops an EX form in which she looks more mature, has wings, and/or wields a giant dark sword (usually a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormbringer" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Stormbringer">Stormbringer</a>).</li>
<li><b>Sonanoka~</b>: Her catchphrase in fan works is <i>Sōnanokā</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">そーなのかー</span>)</span> which is a pretty childish way of saying "Is that so~." Rumia first says this in <i>Embodiment of Scarlet Devil</i> during <a href="../Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil/Translation/Reimu%27s_Scenario.html#Stage_1" class="mw-redirect" title="Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Translation/Reimu's Scenario">Reimu's scenario</a>. This is reflective of the childish and ditzy personality she's given in most fanart.</li>
<li><b>Team <span lang="ja">⑨</span></b>: In fan works, she is often seen with other lower level, childish characters like <a href="../Cirno.html" title="Cirno">Cirno</a>, <a href="../Mystia_Lorelei.html" title="Mystia Lorelei">Mystia Lorelei</a> and <a href="../Wriggle_Nightbug.html" title="Wriggle Nightbug">Wriggle Nightbug</a> and <a href="../Daiyousei.html" title="Daiyousei">Daiyousei</a>.
<ul><li>"Team <span lang="ja">⑨</span>" is a term used in the Western fandom. In the Japanese community, they (Cirno, Mystia, Rumia, Wriggle) are referred as the "Bakartet"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">バカルテット</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i>bakarutetto</i>, "baka" + "quartet")</span>.</li></ul></li>
<li>The 7th day of the month is known as "Rumia's day" among the fanbase, and various artists are more likely to draw many fanarts involving her. That's because in Japan, this day is also called "nanoka".</li>
<li>Because of her in-game dialogues, and her being described as a man-eater in <i><a href="../Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense.html" title="Perfect Memento in Strict Sense">Perfect Memento in Strict Sense</a></i>, she is often portrayed as a glutton that is extremely fond of meat (most notably <a href="../Human.html" title="Human">humans</a> and <a href="../Mystia_Lorelei.html" title="Mystia Lorelei">Mystia Lorelei</a>). Rumia, <a href="../Yuyuko_Saigyouji.html" title="Yuyuko Saigyouji">Yuyuko Saigyouji</a>, and <a href="../Yoshika_Miyako.html" title="Yoshika Miyako">Yoshika Miyako</a>, are sometimes seen together and are known as the "hungry trio" in the western fanbase.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Daiyousei"><a href="../Daiyousei.html" title="Daiyousei">Daiyousei</a></span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="../../index5fd3-2.html?title=Fandom/Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Daiyousei">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<ul><li><b>Senior</b>: In many fan-fictions, she's described as <a href="../Cirno.html" title="Cirno">Cirno</a>'s senior (usually; they aren't related by blood). In these fictions she is depicted as timid, shy and very kind, especially to Cirno, although still weaker than Cirno.</li>
<li><b>Leader</b>: She's sometimes regarded as the elder or leader of all of the <a href="../Fairy.html" title="Fairy">fairies</a> living around the lake.</li>
<li><b>Large chest</b>: Many fan works interpret "big fairy" or "greater fairy" as meaning having noticeably larger breasts than other fairies or just having large breasts in general.</li>
<li><b>Big vs. Small</b>: Some fanarts like to joke about how the "big fairy" is small and the "little devil" (<a href="../Koakuma.html" title="Koakuma">Koakuma</a>) is big.</li>
<li><b>DAi-chan</b>: As an abbreviation of "Daiyousei", the affectionate name for her is <i>Dai-chan</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">大ちゃん</span>)</span>.</li>
<li><b>DIE-yousei</b>: When she takes on a darker personality and/or is thought of been unusually strong, she is sometimes called DIE-yousei<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">DIE妖精</span>)</span>. This has been used recently to refer to her when she showed up in <i><a href="../Fairy_Wars.html" title="Fairy Wars">Fairy Wars</a></i>.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cirno"><a href="../Cirno.html" title="Cirno">Cirno</a></span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="../../index0d64.html?title=Fandom/Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Cirno">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>Cirno is a quite popular character in the <i><a href="../Touhou_Project.html" title="Touhou Project">Touhou Project</a></i> among fans. Due to becoming a meme, Cirno is now one of the most popular characters of Touhou. Many fans now portray her, jokingly or seriously, as a misunderstood child or even as an outright genius in disguise, or as a bumbling idiot who messes up what everyone else is doing. This is mainly due to fandom making references to her in non-related topics. 
</p>

<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><a href="../File_Th09Screen_Layout.html" class="image"><img alt="" src="../../images/thumb/8/85/Th09Screen_Layout.png/300px-Th09Screen_Layout.png" width="300" height="315" class="thumbimage"></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="../File_Th09Screen_Layout.html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>How Cirno became a <span lang="ja">⑨</span>. The ninth is saying "Idiot".</div></div></div>
<p>Due to the infamous manual screenshot, Cirno has been nicknamed "Nine-ball" or simply "<span lang="ja">⑨</span>". Cirno is known for her childishness (stupidity), so the term "Cirno" is often used instead of "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/baba" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:baba">baka</a>"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">バカ</span>, "fool")</span> as a joke in the Japanese Touhou community. She is also sometimes associated with Nineball (or the Seraph variation) of Armored Core fame in various ways, such as a Cirno in its red/black colors for <i><a href="../MUGEN.html" class="mw-redirect" title="MUGEN">MUGEN</a></i>. It is famed because it's a difficult boss in any game it appears in.
</p><p>The date "09-09-09" (Wednesday, September 9, 2009, 09:09:09, more specifically) has been named "Cirno Day" for obvious reasons. For some reason, numerous aspects of this day everything could be translated into or connected with nine. For example: September 9 is the 252nd day of the year and 2 + 5 + 2 = 9, you need 9 letters to type "Wednesday" or "September", and Japan's timezone is +9. Other names for this day include "The Strongest Day" and "<span lang="ja">⑨</span> Day".
</p>
<dl><dt>Team <span lang="ja">⑨</span></dt></dl>
<p>In fan works, she is often seen with other lower-level, childish characters such as <a href="../Daiyousei.html" title="Daiyousei">Daiyousei</a>, <a href="../Rumia.html" title="Rumia">Rumia</a>, <a href="../Mystia_Lorelei.html" title="Mystia Lorelei">Mystia Lorelei</a>, and <a href="../Wriggle_Nightbug.html" title="Wriggle Nightbug">Wriggle Nightbug</a>. In the English community, this group is often known as "Team <span lang="ja">⑨</span>", and are usually led by Cirno herself. Without Daiyousei, the group is often called the "bakartet", a combination of "baka" and "quartet".
</p><p>However, In the <i><a href="../Touhou_Sangetsusei.html" title="Touhou Sangetsusei">Touhou Sangetsusei</a></i> series, Cirno was seen playing with what presumably was Daiyousei, and at another point she was seen with this group (Excluding Daiyousei) during gatherings involving the <a href="../Three_Fairies_of_Light.html" title="Three Fairies of Light">Three Fairies of Light</a>. (In canon, whether they know each other or just coincidentally end up within the same gathering is unknown.)
</p>
<dl><dt>I'm the strongest!</dt></dl>
<p>Cirno's catchphrase in doujin works, "I'm the strongest!"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">最強だし！</span>)</span>, comes from her dialogue in <i><a href="../Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View.html" title="Phantasmagoria of Flower View">Phantasmagoria of Flower View</a></i>, in which she announces this in her scenario, while being everyone else's stage one boss. She also says it when winning against herself in <i>Phantasmagoria of Flower View</i> and <i><a href="../Touhou_Hisoutensoku.html" title="Touhou Hisoutensoku">Touhou Hisoutensoku</a></i>, in which case she says "when it comes to me, I am the strongest!<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">あたいったら最強ね！</span>)</span>. In English, the phrase may sometimes be purposely corrupted in spelling, e.g. "Eye am the strongest!" or "Eye am <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/teh" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:teh">teh</a> strangest!"
</p>
<dl><dt>Letty</dt></dl>
<p>In other fan works, she is shown with <a href="../Letty_Whiterock.html" title="Letty Whiterock">Letty Whiterock</a>, who is considered as a close friend, guardian, or mentor. This is partly due to the fact that she appears as a midboss in Letty's stage in <i><a href="../Perfect_Cherry_Blossom.html" title="Perfect Cherry Blossom">Perfect Cherry Blossom</a></i>, and partly because they share similar abilities – the manipulation of cold temperature and ice.  Ironically, in her interview in <a href="../Bohemian_Archive_in_Japanese_Red/Letty.html" title="Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red/Letty">Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red</a>, Letty says she doesn't want to be put on the same rank as Cirno.
</p>
<dl><dt>Miscellaneous</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Because Cirno enjoys freezing frogs, many fans consider <a href="../Suwako_Moriya.html" title="Suwako Moriya">Suwako Moriya</a> to have a rivalry with Cirno because of Suwako having relations with frogs.</li>
<li>Some fans have made connections with the <a href="../PC-98.html" title="PC-98">PC-98</a> character <a href="../Mai.html" title="Mai">Mai</a> due to their similar fairy-like appearances and their manipulation of ice. She even has a palette in <i>Touhou Hisoutensoku</i> that resembles Mai.</li>
<li>Other fan versions of Cirno are Achi Cirno (Fire Cirno), Ikazu Cirno (Lighning Cirno), Mizu Cirno (Water Cirno), Cirno-nee (adult version of Cirno), and Advent Cirno (parody of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Strife" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cloud Strife">Cloud Strife</a>).</li>
<li>Ever since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:CNN">CNN</a> featured the shadow art video <a href="../Lyrics__Bad_Apple%21%21_(Alstroemeria_Records).html" title="Lyrics: Bad Apple!! (Alstroemeria Records)">Bad Apple!!</a> together with its stop motion counterpart, it has been renamed "Cirno News Network" by some of the Touhou fans. This is because of one reporter's incorrect assessment of the stop-motion video as depicting how the CG shadow art video was made.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup></li>
<li>Cirno in Finland is known as "Sirkku", partly because it's a common Finnish female name and Finnish people having trouble pronouncing "Cirno", "Chiruno" or any other variation of her name.</li>
<li>One of the songs from the Homestuck web-comic series, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/heir-conditioning">Heir Conditioning</a>, uses parts of Cirno's theme in its composition. Heir Conditioning is also composed in a very Touhou-esque style, including aspects such as elaborate piano parts and a trumpet probably meant to mimic the so-called "<a href="../ZUN.html" title="ZUN">ZUNpet</a>". Small traces of <a href="../Utsuho_Reiuji.html" title="Utsuho Reiuji">Utsuho Reiuji</a>'s theme can also be heard. The name of the piece is also a pun on "air conditioning".</li>
<li>Western fans have noticed that her <i><a href="../Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View.html" title="Phantasmagoria of Flower View">Phantasmagoria of Flower View</a></i> depiction resembles a pose as though she is an American rapper due to the way she has her hand.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Hong_Meiling"><a href="../Hong_Meiling.html" title="Hong Meiling">Hong Meiling</a></span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="../../index8d79.html?title=Fandom/Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Hong Meiling">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>Meiling is amongst one of the popular characters in the <i><a href="../Touhou_Project.html" title="Touhou Project">Touhou Project</a></i>. She's shown typically as a Chinese character that has a tendency to be portrayed as a joke character that chronically naps, often earning herself as knife in the head from Sakuya (if not out of breast envy) as well as additional poor treatment from the rest of the <a href="../Scarlet_Devil_Mansion.html" title="Scarlet Devil Mansion">Scarlet Devil Mansion</a>.
</p>
<dl><dt>China</dt></dl>
<p>She is more widely known as "China"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">中国</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i>Chuugoku</i>)</span>, the one whose real name is never remembered. In fanworks, she doesn't take that well which leads her being shunned or defensive of her name. Many Meiling fans don't take it that well either. It is known that in 2ch, there was a debate on how to read Meiling's name. One side said "Hong Meiling", and the other said "Kurenai Misuzu". The debate ended (sort of) when a user said "Why don't we just call her 'China', as her clothing seems to identify her the most." As a result, even after ZUN said "Hong Meiling" is the correct pronunciation in the Meiji University talkshow "Dawn of Touhou," people kept on calling Meiling "China". However, due to the emergence of other memes, this one has become less frequent – many traces of it still remain, though.
</p><p>Meiling's nickname is further ingrained into the minds of fans by her clothing, and also by the name of her stage BGM, "Shanghai Scarlet Teahouse ~ Chinese Tea". Her stage theme tends to be more frequently remixed by fans than her boss theme, "Shanghai Alice of Meiji 17", to the point where "Chinese Tea" became her theme in <i><a href="../Touhou_Hisoutensoku.html" title="Touhou Hisoutensoku">Touhou Hisoutensoku</a></i>.
</p><p>However, other sources and media may or may not read Chinese names in the on'yomi format; in Meiling's case, her name would've been read as Kou Birei/Mirin.
</p>
<dl><dt>Being lazy</dt></dl>
<p>She is commonly referred to as the "lazy guardian" of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, though whether this stems from her actual personality or from the nickname "China" is unknown. Many Japanese people complain about the reliability and quality of products manufactured in China. There are many fanfics that depict an enraged Sakuya behind a sleeping Meiling in front of the gates to the Mansion. The implication is that she has the "Chinese" quality of <i>Reliable China</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">信頼の中国</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i>Shinrai no Chuugoku</i>)</span>, with much intended sarcasm.
</p>
<dl><dt>Sakuya relation</dt></dl>
<p>Her relationship with Sakuya seems to be a popular topic for fan work, including comics, music and games. One running gag involves her being stabbed by Sakuya's knives, often in the head. A reference to this was made in <i><a href="../Wild_and_Horned_Hermit.html" title="Wild and Horned Hermit">Wild and Horned Hermit</a></i>, but only with Sakuya holding knifes with the look that she wants to stab her. This is however usually due to her inability to keep unwanted visitors, mostly <a href="../Marisa_Kirisame.html" title="Marisa Kirisame">Marisa Kirisame</a>, out of the mansion. In canon, Meiling doesn't appear to be chastised for failing to keep Marisa out (canonically, she is known to be rather versatile at her job and the witch is the only known person whom she can't stop from intruding, though Marisa tends to come in via a friendly visit).
</p><p>It is also common for fan works to depict Meiling caring for Sakuya when the latter was a child. This scenario is somewhat plausible due to Meiling being a youkai and Sakuya being human, making it likely that Meiling is several decades older than Sakuya. Additionally, they both have the distinction of being the only characters in <i><a href="../Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil.html" title="Embodiment of Scarlet Devil">Embodiment of Scarlet Devil</a></i> to have braided sideburns with ribbons. This fact supports that setting.
</p>
<dl><dt>Flandre relation</dt></dl>
<p>In fanworks, Meiling seems to be some sort of big sister or playmate to Flandre (rather than Remilia). In comedy works, it can be to throw Meiling in the way of more danger. In serious ones, her laid back approach to her job and uncontrollably friendly nature as well as her seeming toughness make her a natural choice for reaching out to an otherwise isolated Flandre. Many fan works depict the two going out of their way to help each other on numerous occasions.She is also seen as a big sister figure for other younger characters such as Cirno.
</p>
<dl><dt>Species</dt></dl>
<p>Her race remains unconfirmed, but she's commonly associated with dragons due to her many shared motifs with them, such as her use of rainbows, hat, and name, and possible inspiration by the Chinese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_(rainbow-dragon)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hong (rainbow-dragon)">Hong</a>. This is most prevalent during depictions of her theoretical EX mode in which she often adopts dragon characteristics. Though some use the term "Ex-Meiling" to refer to Meiling getting serious, often showing considerable amounts of power/durability and hiding it for various reasons.
</p>
<dl><dt>Miscellaneous</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Seki/Red Shine has started a trend of Meiling assuming the form for a fluffy panda, which is shown to be very friendly to most people. This form is not helpless as it has been seen jumping out of a pitfall of Tewi's to considerable heights. A few other artists have copied the trend.</li>
<li>A popular Flash animation called "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://yuki.kitune.info/hikari/flash/mizkan.html">My Name is Hong Meiling</a>" spawned the meme "Sakuya-san, Sakuya-san, cleaning stop! Room cleaning stop!" (after which she gets stabbed in the forehead with a knife).</li>
<li>In the MUGEN community, Meiling is known for her "Chuugoku Satsu" attack, an obvious parody of both her nickname "Chuugoku" (<i>China</i>), and the signature attack "Shun Goku Satsu" (<i>Instant Hell Murder</i>) of Akuma from Street Fighter.</li>
<li>Due to her comedic scenario in <i><a href="../Touhou_Hisoutensoku.html" title="Touhou Hisoutensoku">Touhou Hisoutensoku</a></i> and the nature of one of her battles (with a rather simplified background image), fans have made numerous jokes regarding drug experimentation on Meiling's part.</li>
<li>In some fan works, Meiling is known to say "JAOOOO"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">じゃおおおお</span>)</span>, a war-cry attributed to her. This cry originated from the 2nd <i><a href="../Touhou_M-1_Grand_Prix.html" title="Touhou M-1 Grand Prix">Touhou M-1 Grand Prix</a></i> (<a href="../Comiket_73.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Comiket 73">Comiket 73</a>).</li>
<li>Despite her sometimes joke status in fanon, Meiling is often considered a difficult boss fight in <i>Embodiment of Scarlet Devil</i> on Lunatic if not Hard as well.</li>
<li>Meiling is sometimes compared to Chun-Li from Street Fighter on notable traits.</li></ul>

<ul><li>In many fan-fictions, she's regarded as a familiar of Patchouli. In those fictions, she works as a librarian and a personal servant of Patchouli. Some of those fictions also portray Koakuma as originating from <a href="../Makai.html" title="Makai">Makai</a>.</li>
<li>In many fictions, she's described to be very obedient, steady and good-natured, on the contrary to ZUN's official profile. This personality is acknowledged before <a href="../ZUN.html" title="ZUN">ZUN</a> replied to the question, and it's one of exceptional example of a fan-made profile which is accepted by a large majority (but not all fans).
<ul><li>After ZUN's reply, some people described more impish and mischievous Koakuma in their fan-fictions. Today, various Koakumas exist in fan-fictions: Obedient and steady, impish and mischievous, or a combination of both.</li></ul></li>
<li>Koakuma is sometimes drawn by fans having a pair of black, bat-like wings on her back to match the ones on the sides of her head.</li>
<li>Fans commonly portray Patchouli as having multiple "Koakumas" assisting her, just as the Scarlet Devil Mansion has numerous <a href="../Fairy_Maid.html" title="Fairy Maid">Fairy Maids</a>. A common one is the differences between her <i>Strange and Bright Nature Deity</i> and her <i>Embodiment of Scarlet Devil</i> where she's shown to be two completely different people, one with short hair and other with long. <i><a href="../Super_Marisa_World.html" title="Super Marisa World">Super Marisa World</a></i> makes a good example of this.</li>
<li>Some fanart either imply she's a sort of succubus or just give her a sexy figure due to the "devil" part and headwings.</li>

Since then, fan works have often depicted her using this sound as a sign of surprise or pouting.</li>
<li>Along with "One-week Girl", she's also referred to as the "One-week Wizard" or the "Wizard of the Week" due to her elemental magics coinciding with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week-day_names#East_Asian_Seven_Luminaries" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Week-day names">days of the week on a Japanese calendar</a>.</li>
<li>Multiple nicknames are used for Patchouli. Her <a href="../Canon.html" title="Canon">canon</a> nickname "Pache"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">パチェ</span>)</span> is commonly used in fandom. Non-canon nicknames used include "Pachu"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">パチュ</span>)</span>, a less common name shortened from "Pachurii"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">パチュリー</span>)</span>, and "Patchy" that's used mainly by Western fans.</li>
<li>Patchouli has been rumored to be the inspiration for the character <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Negima!_Magister_Negi_Magi_characters#Yue_Ayase" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of Negima! Magister Negi Magi characters">Yue Ayase</a> from the manga <i>Negima! Magister Negi Magi</i>. Like Patchouli, Yue is a short, quiet girl with long purple hair, an unexcitable personality, an affinity for books and magic. She's also known to dress in a witch outfit similar to Marisa's.</li>
<li>In other fan comics, Patchouli is considered a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hikikomori">hikikomori</a> due to her apparent habit of spending all her time in one room (the library) and rarely ever stepping outside.

<li>She is infamous for having a "Variable figure" as she could very well have any kind of figure under her robes, from stick-thin to outright fat.

<p>Sakuya is one of the most popular characters in the <i><a href="../Touhou_Project.html" title="Touhou Project">Touhou Project</a></i>. She sometimes appears to be an icon for the <i>Touhou Project</i> and has appeared in many fangames, mostly as a playable character or a <a href="../Boss.html" title="Boss">boss</a>, and in other fan-made anime and artwork. She is also a target for various memes and jokes.
</p>
<dl><dt>Characteristics</dt></dl>
<p>Sakuya's personality and characteristics are a bit different in the fanbase, such as sometimes been seen with nosebleeds in the presence of <a href="../Remilia_Scarlet.html" title="Remilia Scarlet">Remilia Scarlet</a> or <a href="../Flandre_Scarlet.html" title="Flandre Scarlet">Flandre Scarlet</a>. In some fan-produced works, Sakuya is depicted with puppy ears and a tail. This is commonly called "Dog Sakuya"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">犬咲夜</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i>inusakuya</i>)</span> or <span lang="ja">いぬさくや</span>, which is probably a reflection of various characters referring to her as Remilia's dog. Various characters have treated Sakuya as a dog.
</p><p>There's a recurring joke with fans that Sakuya <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsies" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Falsies">pads</a> her chest to make her breasts look bigger than they are and goes to great lengths on hiding this secret, even from Remilia herself. The origin of this was due to Sakuya's portraits in <i><a href="../Immaterial_and_Missing_Power.html" title="Immaterial and Missing Power">Immaterial and Missing Power</a></i>, which showed her with larger breasts than those seen on <a href="../ZUN.html" title="ZUN">ZUN</a>-made portraits. Thus, <i>PAD-chou</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">ＰＡＤ長</span>)</span> has become a popular phrase that is frequently seen with <i>Meido-chou</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">メイド長</span>)</span>, but fans tend to be careful when they use it as there is another common joke where Sakuya stabs anyone who says this phrase (or even simply saying "PAD"), which is coincidentally similar to the infamous <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/candlejack">Candlejack</a> meme. There are many people hating that phrase. Some art also has Sakuya as curvy and without the severe complex.
</p><p>Additionally, a common fanon scenario is <a href="../Marisa_Kirisame.html" title="Marisa Kirisame">Marisa Kirisame</a> baring in sparks a blazing with <a href="../Hong_Meiling.html" title="Hong Meiling">Hong Meiling</a> being asleep (or failing to stop her) and Sakuya trying to stop her (to no avail), ending with Sakuya stabbing Meiling in the head. This plays out still today despite <a href="../Canon.html" title="Canon">canon</a> debunking the whole scenario entirely.
</p>
<dl><dt>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</dt></dl>
<p>Sakuya may be a homage to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dio_Brando" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dio Brando">Dio Brando</a>, the main villain of the manga series <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:JoJo's Bizarre Adventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></i>, a <a href="../Vampire.html" title="Vampire">vampire</a> who is known for stopping time and being skilled at throwing knives. <i>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</i> has been referenced several times in the official games. Related to the theory that Sakuya may have committed devilish homicide before, one of Dio's former subordinates was Jack the Ripper. Yumiya shows a dysfunctional relationship between them, with Sakuya being his daughter.
</p>
<dl><dt>Relationshipping</dt></dl>
<p>Some fanworks compare her to <a href="../Youmu_Konpaku.html" title="Youmu Konpaku">Youmu Konpaku</a> due to several similarities, as not only for their white hair, they both have red eyes shifting to blue in later artworks, both having bladed weapons, and being <a href="../Stage.html" title="Stage">Stage</a> 5 bosses, as well as undying loyalty to their masters and play homage to <i>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</i>, as well as sharing an interesting dialogue towards <a href="../Hong_Meiling.html" title="Hong Meiling">Hong Meiling</a> when they defeat her in <i>Touhou Hisoutensoku</i>. Also, Sakuya's alternate Dio palette may be considered to be gold instead of yellow, which coincidentally corresponds well with Youmu's silver palette; thus the two can also be seen in a "gold&amp;silver" manner. Youmu's case is also somewhat enforced due to her <i>JoJo</i> reference being a character having prior ties to Dio (said character being Jean Pierre Polnareff).
</p>
<ul><li>Recently, Sakuya, Youmu and Remilia via their <i>Koumajou Densetsu II</i> portrayals also share voice actresses with three other JoJo characters (being Jolyne Cujoh, Reimi Sugimoto and Yasuho Hirose respectively) in <i>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle</i>.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>Playable character</dt></dl>
<p>Since the announcement of <i><a href="../Undefined_Fantastic_Object.html" title="Undefined Fantastic Object">Undefined Fantastic Object</a></i> and of <a href="../Sanae_Kochiya.html" title="Sanae Kochiya">Sanae Kochiya</a> as the only new playable character (along with <a href="../Reimu_Hakurei.html" title="Reimu Hakurei">Reimu Hakurei</a> and <a href="../Marisa_Kirisame.html" title="Marisa Kirisame">Marisa Kirisame</a>), jokes and fanart of Sakuya shows her being venomously jealous of Sanae's newfound popularity and prominence commenced due to not being a playable character. She's also compared to <a href="../Mima.html" title="Mima">Mima</a> dues to this fact. With <i><a href="../Ten_Desires.html" title="Ten Desires">Ten Desires</a></i> and Youmu Konpaku being the heroine there, jokes range from Sakuya in despair to some depictions of her proud of Youmu (Thanks to the Onee-sama trait Sakuya has with Youmu in fandom). Beforehand, a small amount of fanworks have portrayed Sakuya, Youmu, <a href="../Reisen_Udongein_Inaba.html" title="Reisen Udongein Inaba">Reisen Udongein Inaba</a> and Mima to be all jealous of Sanae.
</p><p>With Sakuya's return as the sole playable character with Reimu and Marisa in <i><a href="../Double_Dealing_Character.html" title="Double Dealing Character">Double Dealing Character</a></i>, it's become increasingly common to paint her as another girlfriend of <a href="../ZUN.html" title="ZUN">ZUN</a>, like it was done with <a href="../Aya.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Aya">Aya</a> and <a href="../Sanae.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Sanae">Sanae</a> before. She may also be drawn knifing both Sanae and Youmu in the head. This ignores the fact that the characters are pretty indifferent to incidents that do not affect their Masters and/or homes.
</p>
<dl><dt>Miscellaneous</dt></dl>
<ul><li>There's a theory that the reason why Sakuya works for <a href="../Remilia_Scarlet.html" title="Remilia Scarlet">Remilia Scarlet</a> is because Remilia manipulated fate on Sakuya. Even <a href="../Hieda_no_Akyuu.html" title="Hieda no Akyuu">Hieda no Akyuu</a> believes this theory. However, another possibility is that maybe she is acting as a treacherous insider, for when she sees an opening.</li>
<li>As the head <a href="../Maid.html" title="Maid">maid</a>, "maid-boss"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">メイド長</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i>maid-chou</i>)</span> is the common title used to address her among fans. Another common nickname is <i>Sakkyun</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">さっきゅん</span>)</span>.</li>
<li>Some western fans may give her the title "time-stopping, knife-throwing ninja maid" or "knife-throwing ninja" due to her abilities.</li>
<li>Due to said theories on the <a href="../Sakuya_Izayoi.html#Mystery_and_Theory" title="Sakuya Izayoi">Mystery and Theory</a> section, some fans do take these speculations seriously and class Sakuya to be both indeed a <a href="../Lunarian.html" title="Lunarian">Lunarian</a> and/or a vampire hunter.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Remilia_Scarlet"><a href="../Remilia_Scarlet.html" title="Remilia Scarlet">Remilia Scarlet</a></span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="../../indexa0bc-2.html?title=Fandom/Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Remilia Scarlet">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<dl><dt>Charisma Break</dt></dl>
<p>The best known meme associated with Remilia is "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Charisma" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Charisma">Charisma</a> Break", or her noble composure breaking revealing her childish side. It's not clear what exactly inspired it but a leading factor is her crouching block pose in the fighting games. Various artists take different routes with this meme, with some having others enjoy seeing it happen while others have it happen at the drop of a hat.
</p><p>There are some artists who subvert this by having Remilia's composure remain intact no matter what happens. This has some basis in canon as Remilia is fond of acting like a vampire while having some childish tendencies (such as her crouching block).
</p>
<dl><dt>Manipulation of fate</dt></dl>
<p>Some fan works have postulated that Remilia uses her power to manipulate fate unconsciously. Otherwise, it would be far too great a power. For instance, if she was able to control a person's fate actively, she could have made it <a href="../Reimu_Hakurei.html" title="Reimu Hakurei">Reimu Hakurei</a>'s fate to lose to her. (Although the <a href="../Spell_card.html" title="Spell card">spell card</a> Rules prevent this) However, <a href="../ZUN.html" title="ZUN">ZUN</a> has hinted otherwise in Sakuya's <i><a href="../Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense/Sakuya_Izayoi.html" title="Perfect Memento in Strict Sense/Sakuya Izayoi">Perfect Memento in Strict Sense</a></i> article, where <a href="../Hieda_no_Akyuu.html" title="Hieda no Akyuu">Hieda no Akyuu</a> has speculated that Remilia may have manipulated Sakuya's fate in such a way that she could have a more friendly relationship with other human beings. Should that prove to be true, it would mean that Remilia can indeed intentionally, or at least consciously, manipulate fate.
</p><p>Some fans think her ability enables the desired effect, but not how it happens or how long it takes for it to happen. This would make it an ability poorly suited for fast wins but make it very useful for long term schemes, something vampires are said to be fond of.
</p>
<dl><dt>Against a vampire's weakness</dt></dl>
<p>While its common to have a parasol with Remilia (and Flandre) in fanworks, many works have Remilia to not be weak against her weaknesses, such as garlic, sunlight and water, even though these are hazardous to Remilia. she can be seen swimming in water, not bothered about garlic, or even walking in broad daylight. These kind of fanworks make people come to conclusions that she is actually a vampire "daywalker", or has recently become one. This would be due to not enough research was put to what weaknesses Remilia has, but some fans conclude that going outside in sunlight parasol-less is <a href="../Canon.html" title="Canon">canon</a> because of her custom parasol system card in <i><a href="../Touhou_Hisoutensoku.html" title="Touhou Hisoutensoku">Touhou Hisoutensoku</a></i> allowing to fight outdoors, but without a parasol. This would explain why she can walk outside.
</p>
<dl><dt>Jojo association</dt></dl>
<p>As of late Remilia seems to have been given her own associated character from the <i>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</i> series, much like a number of others. Frequently being crossed over with Diavolo whose stand, King Crimson, erases time for everyone but himself and allows him to see the future, effectively allowing him to alter his immediate fate to suit himself.
</p>
<dl><dt>Miscellaneous</dt></dl>
<ul><li>She is a popular antagonist in some fanworks due to her fondness of being the big bad vampire and her short temper, often with some exaggeration mixed in.</li>
<li>She is sometimes shown as a tsundere in some fanart due to her noblewoman tendencies.</li>
<li>As the older sister, she is commonly called <i>ojou-sama</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">お嬢様</span>)</span> by fans, and is what is primarily used to refer to her. Whenever <a href="../Flandre_Scarlet.html" title="Flandre Scarlet">Flandre Scarlet</a> refers to her sister, though, she is called onee-sama<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">お姉様</span>)</span>. Another common nickname is <i>Remirya</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">れみりゃ</span>)</span> though it's mainly used for cutesy renditions of her.</li>
<li>There is a common joke that <a href="../Sakuya_Izayoi.html" title="Sakuya Izayoi">Sakuya Izayoi</a> calls her ozeu-sama<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">おぜうさま</span>)</span> instead, which has made it a very common nickname for her.</li>
<li>Some western fans will shorten Remilia's name to "Remi" or "Remmy".</li>
<li>A common meme regarding Remilia is "Remilia! Uu-☆"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">れみりあ！うー☆</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i>Remiria! Ū ☆</i>)</span>, which people think is cute.</li>
<li>Some fans (and at least one fancomic) have made fun of her bizarre naming sense (seen in her fighting game spell cards).</li>
<li>While Remilia doesn't actually own the legendary weapon named "Gungnir" (or any weapon at all), she is often depicted wielding an actual spear, as to match Flandre's Laevatein. It's appearance ranges from a simple energy-made weapon (like in her spell card) to a fine and very elegant spear, depending from the artist.</li></ul>

<p>Flandre has not made many appearances in the series, but maybe because of her personality and the way she looks and acts, she's become a very popular character. One reason would be because of her theme music ("U.N.Owen was her?"). It is particularly famous, and is often used in MAD videos, and for a time introduced many as "newcomers hoihoi" on Nico Nico to Touhou. Furthermore, the arrangement "<span lang="ja">最終鬼畜妹フランドール･S</span>" ("Final Savage Sister, Flandre S.") <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> in the album <i><a href="../%e6%9d%b1%e6%96%b9%e3%82%b9%e3%83%88%e3%83%a9%e3%82%a4%e3%82%af.html" title="東方ストライク">Touhou Strike</a></i> by <a href="../COOL%26CREATE.html" title="COOL&amp;CREATE">COOL&amp;CREATE</a> seems to have been mistaken by many to have been the original music.
</p>
<dl><dt>Big sister China</dt></dl>
<p>In fanworks, <a href="../Hong_Meiling.html" title="Hong Meiling">Hong Meiling</a> seems to be some sort of big sister or playmate to Flandre (rather than <a href="../Remilia_Scarlet.html" title="Remilia Scarlet">Remilia Scarlet</a>). In comedy works, it can be to throw Meiling in the way of more danger. In serious ones, her laid back approach to her job and uncontrollably friendly nature make her a natural choice for reaching out to an otherwise isolated Flandre. Many fan works depict the two going out of their way to help each other on numerous occasions.
</p>
<dl><dt>Ex boss inspiration</dt></dl>
<p>There's speculation that most of the Extra Stage <a href="../Boss.html" title="Boss">bosses</a> in the <a href="../Windows.html" title="Windows">windows</a> era up to <i><a href="../Undefined_Fantastic_Object.html" title="Undefined Fantastic Object">Undefined Fantastic Object</a></i> was based, in some way, on Flandre. There are also depictions in fanart with Flandre and some of the other Extra Stage bosses with her. Here are the following reasons:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="../Koishi_Komeiji.html" title="Koishi Komeiji">Koishi Komeiji</a> is one of the most popular ones. This stems from the fact that they both possess greater powers than those of their sisters <a href="../Satori_Komeiji.html" title="Satori Komeiji">Satori Komeiji</a> and <a href="../Remilia_Scarlet.html" title="Remilia Scarlet">Remilia Scarlet</a>. Also, Flandre and Koishi are the younger sister to their sister, who both own a mansion.
<ul><li>Some fans think Koishi's ability would make it easier for her and Flandre to communicate.</li></ul></li>
<li>Depictions with <a href="../Nue_Houjuu.html" title="Nue Houjuu">Nue Houjuu</a> is also common. This stems from the fact that Nue's theme ("Heian Alien") sounds similar to Flandre's theme to some.</li>
<li>Depictions with <a href="../Fujiwara_no_Mokou.html" title="Fujiwara no Mokou">Fujiwara no Mokou</a> has dropped with popularity due to the two above, but are still common. The name <i>Mokou</i> means "Scarlet (younger) Sister" and according to <a href="../ZUN.html" title="ZUN">ZUN</a>, it can also mean "Paint me red", but it has no connection to Flandre. Another reason for the pairing (platonic usually) is that Mokou is immortal and has little to fear from Flandre's destructive strength.</li>
<li>Depictions with <a href="../Suwako_Moriya.html" title="Suwako Moriya">Suwako Moriya</a> are rather uncommon. The only known relation between Suwako and Flandre is that Suwako also has a <a href="../Spell_card.html" title="Spell card">spell card</a> to multiply herself.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>Ronald McDonald</dt></dl>
<p>Flandre has been commonly shown with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_McDonald" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ronald McDonald">Ronald McDonald</a> in a cross-over due to her theme being remixed<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>, which the so-called <a href="../McRoll.html" title="McRoll">McRoll</a> and has been the first contact with Touhou for thousands of western Internet users. People referring to "U.N.Owen was her?" as the McRoll/Ran Ran Du song is a sore point among many long time Touhou fans. In addition to this, videos with her vs Ronald are common, more towards the western fanbase, based on the customisable-fighting game <i><a href="../M.U.G.E.html" title="M.U.G.E.N">M.U.G.E.N</a></i>.
</p>
<dl><dt>Lack of appearance</dt></dl>
<p>Even when compared with a lot of characters in the fanbase, Flandre's appearances in fanworks are limited, likely due to be her limits on movement as her only appearances is within or around the <a href="../Scarlet_Devil_Mansion.html" title="Scarlet Devil Mansion">Scarlet Devil Mansion</a>. The number of appearances in-game and within print works is average compared with many other characters. Although when grouped with other characters from <i><a href="../Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil.html" title="Embodiment of Scarlet Devil">Embodiment of Scarlet Devil</a></i> (Excluding mid-bosses), her appearances do appear to be limited. Another factor would be her high, hardly restrained power as having her playable in any accurate sense would make her overpowered. Though in fangames, most go about giving her a glass cannon build (giving her low defenses) or other flaws to offset her massive attack/power ratings. Also, she may be shown as a one-off boss, simply having a cameo or have a small reference.
</p><p>Strangely, some fans have come up with the idea that Flandre has become a "<a href="../PC-98.html" title="PC-98">PC-98</a> character" who has disappeared from the <i><a href="../Touhou_Project.html" title="Touhou Project">Touhou Project</a></i> (like <a href="../Mima.html" title="Mima">Mima</a> and <a href="../Shinki.html" title="Shinki">Shinki</a>), due to Flandre not making many appearances and because <i><a href="../Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil.html" title="Embodiment of Scarlet Devil">Embodiment of Scarlet Devil</a></i> was released not far from <i><a href="../Mystic_Square.html" title="Mystic Square">Mystic Square</a></i>.
</p><p>Although it is considered senseless by the majority, some fans believe this is due to the issue between fans and <a href="../ZUN.html" title="ZUN">ZUN</a> occurred in the Second Touhou Saimoe Tournament, where Flandre won over <a href="../Suika_Ibuki.html" title="Suika Ibuki">Suika Ibuki</a> and ZUN posted a rough drawing of Suika that hadn't been open to the public with a message saying "don't get defeated by a little sister that hasn't even reached the age of 500!"<sup id="cite_ref-ThShofu14_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ThShofu14-8">[8]</a></sup>, which caused a fuss among some fans in both sides.
</p>
<dl><dt>Miscellaneous</dt></dl>
<ul><li>It has been speculated that her wings are artificial and that she fashioned them herself and then attached them to her body. One source of this is probably due to <a href="../Reimu_Hakurei.html" title="Reimu Hakurei">Reimu Hakurei</a> saying she was unable to fly with those wings and their unusual unnatural appearance. According to fanon, she may have lost her original wings or been born without them.
<ul><li>Some artists go about giving her bat form those wings despite her bat form having normal wings in <i>Embodiment of Scarlet Devil</i>.</li>
<li>Her wings have caused some artists to her be along side Marx (from <i>Kirby Super Star</i>), who has similar wings in his boss form.</li>
<li>Some fans speculate that her wings are made of steel and prisms, creating different colors using the dim lights of the Scarlet Devil Mansion.</li></ul></li>
<li>In some fanworks, the crystals on her wings are sometimes shown to be storage for Magical Power.</li>
<li>A common meme regarding Flandre is "flan-chan ufufu"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">フランちゃんうふふ</span>)</span> since many people attribute the slightly sinister laugh "ufufu" to Flandre, as well as the fact that her name is commonly affectionately abbreviated "Flan-chan"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">フランちゃん</span>)</span>. Also, some fans will simply shorten Flandre's name to "Flan"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">フラン</span>)</span>.</li>
<li>For unknown reasons in fanworks, Flandre is shown to be a very good professional artist. This would be due to being locked away an have got nothing better to do. There was <a href="../../images/5/59/Cirno_vs_flan.jpg" class="internal" title="Cirno vs flan.jpg">one occurrence</a> where Flandre drew a map of the world (through bed-wetting) while <a href="../Cirno.html" title="Cirno">Cirno</a> drew a rubbish-version of <a href="../Reimu_Hakurei.html" title="Reimu Hakurei">Reimu Hakurei</a>.</li>
<li>In many fanworks, Flandre is shown with one or two different personalities, or possibly a bipolar one. One is a personality based on her appearance, been very childish, and the other is a super sadistic and violent mass-murder-like personality, based on her possibly accumulated hate of the years trapped in the mansion. However, this is mostly because Flandre destroys things (humans or youkai) without knowing the meaning of it and because she never learned how to attack things properly.
<ul><li>In more recent fanworks, some have tried giving Flandre a more complex personality that may mix some of those two types along with other aspects or complexes. This may be due to them being more aware of her <i>Bohemian of Archive Red</i> article where she's shown to be neither of the above two.</li></ul></li>
<li>Maybe because of the uniqueness of the phrase "Imouto-sama", many fans use this to refer to her. But in canon, it has been only used once by Patchouli in <a href="../Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil/Story/Marisa%27s_Extra.html" title="Embodiment of Scarlet Devil/Story/Marisa's Extra">Marisa's Extra story</a> in <i>Embodiment of Scarlet Devil</i>. How common it is used by other residents is doubted (most of the character call the others who haven't appeared yet in the game by their title or such indirectly, so they wouldn't reveal their names before their appearances. Perhaps this was the case here too?).</li>
<li>Flandre has become a favourite for people to cross over with the <i>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure</i> character Kira Yoshikage, or to be more exact with his stand, Killer Queen. It's power being to turn anything it touches into a bomb or create invulnerable heat seaker bombs. The destruction level and similarity of this stand has drawn people to put the two together.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Rin_Satsuki"><a href="../Rin_Satsuki.html" title="Rin Satsuki">Rin Satsuki</a></span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="../../index4991.html?title=Fandom/Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: Rin Satsuki">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<ul><li>Fans have different interpretations of her appearance. The most common one is accepting the circle cut as a canonical depiction of Rin then adding color to her with blonde hair, a pink blouse with a red underdress ribbon, as well as having socks that're a light pink in color. <a href="../File_Rin_Satsuki_(Fanart).html" title="File:Rin Satsuki (Fanart).jpg">This</a> is an example.</li>
<li>Many fans suggest that Rin's more of a <a href="../Fan-made_characters.html" title="Fan-made characters">fan-made character</a> rather than an official character by <a href="../ZUN.html" title="ZUN">ZUN</a> since certain facts of her character (such as her appearance and coloring) were suggested by fans. In addition, the fact that she doesn't really have an official appearance in any <i><a href="../Touhou_Project.html" title="Touhou Project">Touhou Project</a></i> work only helps to support this.</li>
<li>Most fans had Rin fit with a negative personality and always being a nobody and/or an unknown person when she's around other characters. The reason for this is she had no appearance in any games, only leaving a trace of her name along with the spell cards she would be using in the source code of <a href="../The_Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil.html" class="mw-redirect" title="The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil">The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil</a>, making her think she doesn't even seem to appear for any reasons. She's also depicted as having jealous feelings towards <a href="../Reimu.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Reimu">Reimu</a> and <a href="../Marisa.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Marisa">Marisa</a>, thinking the above reasons are why ZUN choose her to be the one left out instead of one of them. In other works, she is seen alongside Reimu and Marisa as their friend.</li>
<li>Some fans depict Rin as an insane person, frequently hitting herself and crying.</li></ul>

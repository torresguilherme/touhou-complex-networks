For those of us who run [[Wikipedia:Linux|Linux]] or [[Wikipedia:Mac OS X|Mac OS X]] as our only operating system, finding functional alternatives to [[Windows]] programs can be pretty hard. When we need to run Windows programs, [http://www.winehq.org/ the Wine project] has long been a great emulation system that lets us do such a thing. Basically, it translates Windows functionality into the Linux equivalent to coding, so you can still play your Windows games, work in Photoshop, etc. under Linux and, to a certain extent, Mac OS X.

It's not perfect, however; running games from the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' on Wine is hit-or-miss, but it's possible. This article will explain how Wine works, and how to (maybe) play Windows Touhou games under Wine.

Before we start, this does require a little familiarity with the shell (or command-line interface). [http://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/ This Linux guide] has a nice [http://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_02_02.html introduction to using the shell].

==Installing Wine==
===Linux===
*[https://www.archlinux.org/ Arch Linux]: [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wine See here]
*[http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] and [http://www.debian.org/ Debian]: [http://www.winehq.org/download/deb See Here]
*[http://fedoraproject.org/ Fedora]: [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Wine See Here]
*[http://www.opensuse.org/en/ SuSE]: [http://en.opensuse.org/Wine See Here]
*[http://www.gentoo.org/ Gentoo]: [http://wiki.winehq.org/Gentoo See Here]. Unmasking the git-fetching ebuild is recommend. Adding '''=app-emulation/wine-9999 **''' to '''/etc/portage/package.keywords''' should do the trick. Do emerge -pv wine and check which version it wants to build (it should be '''app-emulation/wine-9999'''). Just be aware, building from Wine's Git repository might not actually work; the code is in constant flux.

===Mac OS X===
'''Using MacPorts'''

If you already have MacPorts installed with all dependencies, simply run &lt;code>$ sudo port install wine&lt;/code> to install with all dependencies.

If you have yet to install MacPorts, refer to this [http://www.macports.org/install.php installation instructions].

'''Using Homebrew'''

Go [http://brew.sh/ here] and install if needed, then run &lt;code>$ brew install wine&lt;/code>

==Using Wine==
Wine puts a hidden directory in your home folder, called &lt;tt>.wine&lt;/tt>, which contains a full representation of a Windows folder hierarchy and miscellaneous library and system files. The &lt;tt>.wine&lt;/tt> folder lives inside your home directory (~/.wine). Inside is another folder called &lt;tt>drive_c&lt;/tt>, which is your Wine install's C: drive folder. If you browse inside this folder (~/.wine/drive_c) you'll probably quickly recognize it's contents from a standard Windows install.

Generally, your Linux distribution will have assigned Windows executable to automatically start within Wine, so double-clicking a Windows executable should generally just work. But if not, you'll have to invoke Wine from your terminal. To do this, navigate to the folder that contains the executable and then invoke Wine.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
~ $ cd .wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/RandomProgram
~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/RandomProgram $ wine program.exe
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>

And that ought to start up your program.

===Running Touhou games===
Running a Touhou game is done the same way, only you might want to specify your locale while invoking Wine so it starts your game as a Japanese program to prevent some serious [[Wikipedia:Mojibake|mojibake]]. This can be done by adding &lt;code>LANG="ja_JP.UTF-8"&lt;/code> before executing Wine.

The example below took the installation of ''[[Double Spoiler]]'' and ran &lt;tt>th125.exe&lt;/tt> which is the game:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
~ $ cd .wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/上海アリス幻樂団/ダブルスポイラー
~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/上海アリス幻樂団/ダブルスポイラー $ LANG="ja_JP.UTF-8" wine th125.exe
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>

'''Note:''' If you are running the language patch version of the game (&lt;tt>en_US&lt;/tt> for example), you won't need no specify this unless if your system locale isn't &lt;tt>en_US.UTF-8&lt;/tt>, specify &lt;code>LANG="en_US.UTF-8"&lt;/code> before the command. Same applies to other language patch as well

'''Running games as 32-bits version of Windows'''

Due to the fact that some games still requires to run as 32-bits installation of Windows and the latest version of Wine usually installs as 64-bits, users need to change &lt;tt>WINEARCH&lt;/tt> to &lt;tt>win32&lt;/tt>. This is necessary if you want to install some missing components as demonstrated in the section below. It is recommended to change the Wine directory (normally &lt;tt>~/.wine&lt;/tt>) to something else and set &lt;code>WINEARCH=win32&lt;/code> before running the game.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/上海アリス幻樂団/ダブルスポイラー $ export WINEPREFIX="~/.wine32"
~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/上海アリス幻樂団/ダブルスポイラー $ export WINEARCH=win32
~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/上海アリス幻樂団/ダブルスポイラー $ LANG="ja_JP.UTF-8" wine th125.exe
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>

===Installing missing native Windows components===

Although most Touhou games should run out of the box with the recent development of Wine, some games might experience instant crash when try to running through Wine. This is mostly because Wine cannot emulate all of the Windows libraries/DLLs therefore leads to missing libraries and such which leads to crash. Before running the game, user should make sure that all necessary components are installed. There are some ways to achieve this:
 
'''Using Winetricks'''

[https://wiki.winehq.org/Winetricks Winetricks] is a helper script to aid in installing Windows components such as dlls, Windows runtime library. With &lt;tt>winetricks&lt;/tt>, all installation of dlls and libraries can be done with merely a command.

Start by installing Winetricks by following the installation instruction provided [https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks here]. After installation. We will install  Execute this command to install "d3dx9_36.dll"

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
~ $ winetricks d3dx9_36
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>

&lt;tt>Winetricks&lt;/tt> also have a GUI, which can be open by executing &lt;code>winetricks&lt;/code> in the Terminal.

'''Note:''' Some libraries such as &lt;tt>dotnet40&lt;/tt> requires to install in a 32-bits environment. 

'''Copy the .dll from the Windows installation folder'''

Another way to temporarily fix a partially-functioning DLL is to replace it with the original file from a Windows install. Here is the way to do it.

'''Note:''' This was done on a 32-bit Vista installation mounted at /mnt/vista32.

First off, to copy the file. Wine's Windows folder is in .wine/drive_c/windows.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
~ $ cp /mnt/vista32/Windows/System32/d3dx9_36.dll .wine/drive_c/windows/system32/
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>

This might be all you need for the new DLL to work. To make sure programs see it, we'll configure it within Wine. Wine has a configuration utility called winecfg; run it from your terminal and you'll see this:&lt;br />
[[File:wine1.png]]&lt;br />
Click the "Libraries" tab:&lt;br />
[[File:wine2.png]]&lt;br />
Under "New override for library", type d3dx9_36, and click "Add" then "Apply":&lt;br />
[[File:wine3.png]]&lt;br />
Now you can click "OK" to exit the utility, or peruse around the other tabs and settings. One issue with loading native Windows DLLs is that they may require original low-level Windows DLLs (i.e. ntdll.dll) that Wine is emulating, and might not work. These are the core DLLs that Wine is emulating and cannot be replaced with native Windows DLLs, else you'll break your Wine folder.

===Wine in Mac OS X===
Wine works similarly in OS X compared to Linux. One issue that Mac users may encounter is incredibly slow 3D graphics performance; this is due to Apple's X11 implementation not supporting hardware OpenGL in older versions of OS X (Tiger and below). If you encounter this, you may want to bite the bullet and upgrade.

===PC-98 Games===
Various emulators such as Neko Project II, T98-Next, and Anex86 all work pretty well under Wine in order to play the [[PC-98]] Touhou games. If you're into two-player ''[[Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream]]'' with a gamepad, [http://www.electracode.com/4/joy2key/JoyToKey%20English%20Version.htm JoyToKey] also works under Wine!

There's even a native port of Neko Project II for Linux and Mac OS X called [http://www.nonakap.org/np2/ Xnp2]. However, there are currently some sound problems that need to be investigated; using np2fmgen in Wine is recommended instead.

==Using VSync patches (and possibly other DLL-based patches) on Linux==
'''Note:''' Wine 1.6 seems to run the VSync patches natively. Only follow these instructions if you're using an older version of Wine, or if you get the Japanese error message that translates to "DLL Injection Failed".

The [[Game Tools and Modifications#Vsync Patches|VSync Patch]] (aka vpatch) disables VSync in the Touhou games to reduce input delay. It can also produce minor speedups, especially in ''[[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''.

Running &lt;tt>vpatch.exe&lt;/tt> in Wine cannot remove all input delay, as there appears to be some inherent input delay caused by running Touhou in Wine in the first place.

Normally, when &lt;tt>vpatch.exe&lt;/tt> is run in Wine, a Japanese error message appears which essentially translates to "DLL Injection Failed". This is because Wine by default doesn't have the capability to modify running programs, which is what &lt;tt>vpatch.exe&lt;/tt> requires. To give Wine this capability, run the following command in a terminal using sudo, su, or root:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
setcap cap_sys_ptrace+epi /usr/bin/wineserver
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>

The directory for wineserver might vary based on the Linux distribution.

If no errors appear, the command was successful, and &lt;tt>vpatch.exe&lt;/tt> should now run properly under Wine. Be sure to exit the terminal after running the command; using Wine with root privileges is [http://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ/#run_as_root bad].

You can verify that &lt;tt>vpatch.exe&lt;/tt> is working by loading a replay and holding the Shift key. If the FPS decreases from 60FPS to 30FPS, then &lt;tt>vpatch.exe&lt;/tt> is working normally.

This fix should also theoretically enable the use of other DLL-based patches, though none have been tested.

Note that this fix will give all applications running under Wine, including potentially malicious applications, the capability to modify running programs. If you're concerned about this, the following command will revoke the added capability:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
setcap -r /usr/bin/wineserver
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>

==Gotchas, Troubleshooting==
{{Main|/Misc fixes|l1=Misc fixes}}

*There are issues with joysticks. If you plug in your joystick while your Touhou game is running, it probably won't notice it.  Make sure it's plugged in and working before running your Touhou game.

*Installing English patches has been known to cause otherwise troublesome games to start working better.

*For ''[[Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]]'' and ''[[Touhou Hisoutensoku]]'', [[hisouten:Linux_support|see here]] (SWR/HSTS Wiki).

*Games running at triple or even quadruple times normally on danmaku games which made the game running faster than normal is common when running with Nvidia GPU. Try to limit the FPS to 60 by enable VSync or adding &lt;tt>VBLANK_MODE=1&lt;/tt> before using &lt;tt>primusrun&lt;/tt> or &lt;tt>optirun&lt;/tt> if you are using a hybrid GPU setup.

The Wine developers are constantly adding and fixing functionality, so while things are still iffy with Touhou games they're definitely improving. See below for a list of the current Touhou bugs on the Wine Bugzilla.

==Outside the official games...==
Touhou doujin games are also hit-or-miss. 

''[[Age of Ethanols]]'' is a .NET game, so it should run natively in Mono.  However, it's coded in part C#, part C++, so it won't work without installing .NET and whatnot from within Wine.

[[Moedan]] works fine in Wine (Wine 1.7.20, MacOSX)

[[Touhou Danmakufu]] 0.12m may or may not work - it worked better in older versions of wine, but crashes on start due to DirectX issues in later versions. ph3 works fine with the exception of .mp3 files not running due to copyright issues on .mp3 files and the consequent inability of Wine to run them as they would normally be run. (Wine 1.7.27, MacOSX)

[[Labyrinth of Touhou]] works fine in Wine. (Wine 1.6 RC-1, MacOSX)

===Using Parallels and VMWare Fusion (Virtualization)===
Another alternative that works very well is to use Parallels Desktop to run the games.

Parallels Desktop version 5.0 runs the main series games very well: All of the Windows danmaku games except for ''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' run without slowdown on a MacBook Pro. ''PCB'' appears to suffer from slowdown for unknown reasons.  

Update: Version 1.00a of Ten Desires can be significantly laggy. Patching to 1.00c resolves all issues and will run the game at 60FPS.

It is important to run the games in full screen, and it is better to use the zoom function to bring the game screen to full screen, at least on a MacBook Pro. Running the games in windowed mode often results in slowdown, and the computer appears to have real difficulties in displaying 640×480 natively (the games will run at 30fps). You can run them in 720×480 just fine, though.

Activate the zoom function through the "Trackpad" pane in System Preferences, and zoom in by putting the mouse in the middle of the screen and holding control and scrolling up with two fingers.

The fighting games (''SWR'' and ''Soku'') have no slowdown during matches, but ''do'' have a serious delay while loading for the match (close to a minute). It's been suggested, but not yet confirmed, that placing the games on the virtual C: drive, rather than on the OSX desktop or other location in OSX, may clear this out; Parallels treats the Mac's hard drive as a network drive, which may slow access.  Netplay has yet to be tested for either the fighters or for ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''.  

If your ''SWR''/''Soku'' display looks strange when run in full screen (usually, a bar at the bottom and right of the screen that displays the desktop), set the game to run in Windowed mode, exit out, and restart the game. Then change it back to full screen in the menu.

The [[PC-98]] games can be run through anex86 without difficulty (so yes, emulation within &lt;s>emulation&lt;/s> virtualization). There's a PC-98 emulator for OSX, but it has not been updated for several years and does not appear to accept the Touhou games.

The following fan games have been confirmed to run fine under Parallels Desktop 5 using Windows XP on a MacBook Pro:
*''[[MegaMari]]''
*''[[PatchCon]]''
*''[[Genius of Sappheiros]]'' (with or without English patch)
*''[[Koumajou Densetsu: Scarlet Symphony]]'' (both games)
*''[[Gensou Tansaku Nitroid!]]''

The following do ''not'' run under Parallels 5, have severe slowdown, or suffer from fatal glitches, although in some cases this may be due to the graphics card (apparently, some of the fangames don't communicate properly with NVIDIA cards.):
*''[[Super Marisa World]]'' (runs at 30FPS)
*''[[Mountain of Faith]] Phantasm'' (runs at 30FPS)
*''[[Sengou Gensokyo]]'' (cannot input commands during battle, otherwise 100%)
*''[[Labyrinth of Touhou]]'' (either will not display, or overwhelming glitches)
*''[[Touhou Soccer Moushuuden]]'' (no display)

For unknown reasons, VMWare Fusion will not run the Touhou games properly The games have not yet been tested with Parallels Desktop 6. Stay tuned for information.

==Playing Touhou Games on Steam==
With the release of some title such as [https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons Hidden Star in Four Seasons] or [https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Antinomy_of_Common_Flowers Antinomy of Common Flowers] on Steam and the support of [https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1696055855739350561 Proton]. Playing Touhou games on Steam has become easier since now you can use the built in compatibility layers that Steam provided.

'''Note:''' Proton is a new project and is likely to have bugs, users are encouraged to report any bug they found with games to the project Github Repository. Note that if any game were proved to successfully run on Wine it might often as well run on Proton.
===Installation===
*[https://www.archlinux.org/ Arch Linux]: [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/steam See here]
*[http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu]: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Valve See Here]
*[https://www.debian.org/ Debian]: [https://wiki.debian.org/Steam See here]

To enable Proton for all game please go to '''Steam -> Settings''', a section called '''Steam Play''' will appear in the bottom of the sections list, navigate to the section and check '''Enable Steam Play for all titles''' then you are good to go.

After that you can open your Library and select the game, Proton will do the rest of the job for you.

Game compatibility can be found here: https://www.protondb.com/.

===Troubleshooting===
*Some user might experience game crashing with Proton right when starting up without it prompting to install any drivers (e.g Proton need to install DirectX initially if you are running HSiFS for the first time). If that is the case, consider using the flatpak version of Steam.
*There is also some problem regarding launching games that come from ntfs partitions. This is confirmed as a bug, a workaround for this is to mount the partition using [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NTFS-3G ntfs-3g] rather than ntfs.

==Another Way of Running Touhou Games on Mac==
There is an easier way of running Touhou Games on a Mac. You need a Mac OSX with version 10.6.8 or later, X11, and Winebottler. 11 is available at the iTunes Store, at a cheap price, or free if you get older versions.

You can download Winebottler [http://darwine-winebottler.en.softonic.com/mac here.] Press the free download button, and a Disk Image should appear on your desktop after download. Drag the application Wine and Winebottler into your applications folder.

Now, double click the Touhou game &lt;tt>.exe&lt;/tt>. A dialogue box should pop up that says "What would you like to do with the file?" Below that should be two options:

#Run directly in /Users/((Homefoldername))/Wine
#Convert to simple OS X application bundle.

Click on the first option. '''DO NOT CLICK THE SECOND ONE. The game will not run and your Wine will crash.''' 

It should automatically open up X11 and run the game. No coding is required.

==[[Glitch]]es==
*Most of the Touhou games, especially the 2nd gen [[Windows]] games, might experience minor to unacceptable slowdown on Intel Integrated Graphics (needs to be confirmed; does this slowdown also occur on dedicated graphics cards?)
*&lt;strike>''EoSD'', ''PCB'', and ''[[Imperishable Night]]'' will automatically glitch if you click the screen after loading the game. You controls will start going wonky and most likely you will have to quit Wine and X11. If you run the games for a prolonged period the in-game music will stop, and no matter how many times you quit Wine and start up the game again, the music will be gone.&lt;/strike> Controls going wonky can be resolved by opening the game's &lt;tt>custom.exe&lt;/tt> and checking the box with the word "DirectInput". Also, the audio bugs should be fixed as of PulseAudio 1.0 &amp; Alsa 1.0.25 ([http://wiki.winehq.org/Sound#line-77 source])
*Wine 1.4 does not exhibit any issues when the game runs at full screen.
*&lt;strike>Out of the 3 fighting games, only ''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]'' works. ''SWR'' and ''Soku'' will appear as a black screen before Wine crashes.&lt;/strike>
*&lt;strike>TD will not work on Wine. I have a feeling that nothing after TD will work, since you will have to install some Windows software before playing it.&lt;/strike> TD seems to work in Wine 1.4, though my old laptop is physically unable to run the 2nd gen windows games at more than 15fps.
*In-game English dialogue of ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'', ''[[Subterranean Animism]]'', ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'' and ''[[Fairy Wars]]'' will not appear. Of all the Windows games, in-game Japanese dialogue will appear as code.
*All of the games will run on Normal FPS (that is, 60 or above), unless you have CPU fan wasting applications open.
*There may be a glitch where after opening the game ''PoFV'', ''IN'' will no longer work.

(Note that these glitches are attributed to running of games using Winebottler (only) and X11 (the section above) I haven't tried the code way to open up games. If there is a new, improved version of Winebottler that works just like Wine, please tell me!)
